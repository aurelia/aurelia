# Getting Help With Aurelia

We love our developer community and want to see that each and every developer has the resources they need to achieve success with Aurelia. We have several channels open that you can leverage to get the help you need.

## Aurelia is doing something it should not, or is not doing something it should, and I can show you

Some people feel like they need to submit code to contribute, but helping us identify bugs or gaps in functionality is one of the best ways you can help. If you think you've found a bug, or if you have a feature request, please [submit an issue on Github](https://github.com/aurelia/aurelia/issues/new/choose) and follow the instructions in the issue template. We prioritize high-quality issues, so **be sure to include a description and a working example of the current behavior** as well as a description of the desired behavior when you submit your issue.

## Aurelia is doing something it should not, or is not doing something it should, but I can't show you

Sometimes you will encounter an issue in your application, but when you try to reproduce it the issue disappears. In these cases it is very hard for us to tell if the issue is with Aurelia or not. Your best bet will be to head over to the [Aurelia discourse](https://discourse.aurelia.io) to see if anyone else has had the same issue. First, search through existing posts to see if anyone has already found a solution. If you can't find your problem, submit a new post in the [help requests category](https://discourse.aurelia.io/c/help-requests). Be sure to make your post as descriptive as possible by including your code, describing any attempts you've made at fixing the problem, and linking to a working example of the problem if possible. Finally, be patient and respectful as people are taking time out of their busy schedules to help a fellow Aurelia developer.

## I'm trying to fix a bug or add a feature, but I'm not sure I'm doing it right

We love it when Aurelia developers take the time to dive into the Aurelia codebase. Good on you! However, there's a lot of complicated code and we know firsthand how intimidating that can be. For quick questions and discussions that will help you get on the right path, head over to our [Aurelia discourse](https://discourse.aurelia.io) and post your question in the appropriate channel. We'll do our best to keep you on the right track.

## I want a bug fixed or a feature added but I don't think I can handle it
