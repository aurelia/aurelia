# Internationalization

## Introduction

This documentation explains how to get up and running with Aurelia-I18N
in order to provide localization and internationalization features with your app.

Under the hood it uses [i18next](http://i18next.com/), which is a generalized
open source library with an extensive set of features. By building on top of it
not only can you reuse your work across various other platforms and frameworks
but you are able to use an extensive eco-system full of various packages.

## Getting Started

## Migration Guide & Breaking Changes

- `I18N` --> `I18nService`
- Change in API: nf, df
- relative time format
  - method in `I18nService` instead of a full-fledged class
  - registering translation resources is not required
  - polyfill might be needed for the browsers, do not yet support `Intl.RelativeTimeFormat`
  - no 'now' for <1s time diff; treated as 1s
- All VCs are now signalable
