## Introduction

This documentation explains how to get up and running with Aurelia-I18N
in order to provide localization and internationalization features with your app.

Under the hood it uses [i18next](http://i18next.com/), which is a generalized
open source library with an extensive set of features. By building on top of it
not only can you reuse your work across various other platforms and frameworks
but you are able to use an extensive eco-system full of various packages.

## Getting Started

> Note
> If you have already used `aurelia-i18n` plugin previously and are looking for the migrating your existing Aurelia app to Aurelia vNext then [jump to migration guide](#migration-guide--breaking-changes).

Install the plugin.

```
npm i @aurelia/i18n
```

Register the plugin in your app.

```typescript
import { I18nConfiguration } from '@aurelia/i18n';
import { Aurelia } from '@aurelia/runtime';

new Aurelia()
  .register(
    I18nConfiguration.customize((options) => {
      options.initOptions = {
        resources: {
          en: { translation: { key: "Hello I18N"} },
          de: { translation: { key: "Hallo I18N"} },
        }
      };
    })
  )
  .app({ host, component })
  .start();
```

The above example shows how to initialize the i18n plugin and thereby i18next with translation resources.
There are alternatives of doing that, which is discussed [later](#managing-translation-resources).
Once registered, the plugin can be used in view using the translation attribute (default attribute is `t`, though [alias can be configured](#customize-translation-attribute-alias)), and the translation keys configured.

```html
<span t="key"></span>
```

During runtime, Aurelia will replace the `textContent` of the `span` with the string "Hello I18N", considering the currently active locale is `en`.
If you [change the locale](#changing-the-locale) to `de` for example, then on runtime, the text will be changed to "Hallo I18N".

That was just the "hello world" example of `@aurelia/i18n`.
The plugin can do more than just that; for details read on.

## Installing the Plugin

* Aurelia CLI
* JSPM ??
* Webpack
* other ??

## Registering the plugin

As told earlier, the plugin uses `i18next` under the hood.
During registration, the [options to initialize `i18next`](https://www.i18next.com/overview/api#init) can be passed on.
There are 2 ways the plugin can be registered.
- Default options
  ```typescript
  new Aurelia().register(I18nConfiguration)
  ```
  This initialize the plugin, as well as `i18next` with default options.
  However, often the default settings will not suffice.
- Customized options
  ```typescript
  new Aurelia()
    .register(I18nConfiguration.customize((options)=>{
      options.initOptions = {
        resources: {
          en: { translation: { key: "Hello I18N"} },
          de: { translation: { key: "Hallo I18N"} },
        }
      };
    }));
  ```
  The `customize` function with a callback can be used to customize the initialization of `i18next` (other use-cases follow).
  The `options.initOptions` can be mutated to affect the initialization of `i18next`.
  Every options that can be used in [`i18next.init`](https://www.i18next.com/overview/api#init) can be used here.

  Additionally, any [`i18next` plugins](https://www.i18next.com/overview/plugins-and-utils) can be used using `options.initOptions.plugins` array, as shown below.

  ```typescript
  import * as intervalPlural from 'i18next-intervalplural-postprocessor';

  new Aurelia()
   .register(I18nConfiguration.customize((options)=>{
     options.initOptions = {
       plugins: [intervalPlural] // depending on your tsconfig this might also be intervalPlural.default
     };
   }));
  ```

  A common use-case of `i18next` plugin in described [here](#i18next-backend-plugin).

### Customize translation attribute alias
As you may have already noticed that in view translated resources can be accessed using the following syntax.

```html
<element t="key"></element>
```

The `t` attribute (find the details [here](#translation)) is used by the plugin by default.
In case that creates a conflict (maybe there is an existing custom attribute named `t` in your app), an alias of this attribute can be registered as follows.

```typescript
new Aurelia()
  .register(
    I18nConfiguration.customize((options) => {
      options.translationAttributeAliases = ['i18n', 'tr'];
    })
  )
```

The registered aliases can then be used in view in place of `t`, as shown below.

```html
<element i18n="key1"></element>
<element tr="key2"></element>
```

### Managing translation resources

Typically that the translation resources used in `i18next` is plain JSON objects.
If you are unfamiliar such translation resources, it takes following form.

```json
{
  "key": "value of key",
  "complex": {
    "nested": {
      "resource": {
        "key": "value of nested resource key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
For this example, the key expression `key` will be evaluated to `'value of key'`, whereas `complex.nested.resource.key` will be evaluated to `'value of nested resource key'`.
In the previous examples, the resources are defined inline.
As the application grows, it is likely that the translation resource will also grow with that.
With that the inline resources gets cumbersome.
A typical practice is to externalize the JSON resources to its own file.
There are two approaches how those files can be used in the application which are elaborated in the following sections.

#### Bundling the resource files

A straightforward approach would be to import the JSON resources to app (depending on your build system), and use those in the `customize` function.
The example below shows how to do that.

```typescript
import * as de from 'path_to_locales/de/translation.json';
import * as en from 'path_to_locales/en/translation.json';

new Aurelia()
  .register(
    I18nConfiguration.customize((options) => {
      options.initOptions = {
        resources: {
          en: { translation: en },
          de: { translation: de },
        }
      };
    })
  );
```

This is quite handy strategy for small app, with trivial amount of translated text.
However, if there are multiple languages supported in your app, and the amount of translations for each locale is non-trivial, then this might not be the optimal choice, considering your build system supports bundling.
The reason being that all the translation resources gets bundled with the app, even if all the resources are not used in real time.
Thus, this approach might increase the bundle size needlessly, which in turn might affect the startup time of your app.

#### i18next Backend plugin

Another approach is to asynchronously load the resource file when needed.
To this end, [`i18next` Backend plugins](https://www.i18next.com/overview/plugins-and-utils#backends) can be used.
Whenever, the language is changed in `i18next`, it will use the registered Backend to fetch the resource files, so that keys can be translated for the new locale.

For this example, we use [`i18next-fetch-backend`](https://github.com/perrin4869/i18next-fetch-backend) that uses `fetch` to load the resource files.

```typescript
import Fetch from 'i18next-fetch-backend';

new Aurelia()
  .register(
    I18nConfiguration.customize((options) => {
      options.initOptions = {
        plugins: [Fetch],
        backend: {
          loadPath: '/locales/{{lng}}/{{ns}}.json',
        }
      };
    })
  );
```
This way, no translation resources get bundled with the app.
Instead `i18next` instructs the registered Backend to load the translation resource using the `loadPath` pattern `'/locales/{{lng}}/{{ns}}.json'`.
Note that `{{lng}}` stands for locale name, and `{{ns}}` for namespace.
The default namespace used by `i18next` is `translation` (which can of cource be changed using init options).
For example, for locale `en`, it is expected that the a `translation.json` is available under `/locales/en`.
Thus, you have to ensure that those translation resources are accessible under correct path.

**Recipes**

This section shows couple of recipes to make those resources available for Backend.

- `webpack-dev-server`: Use `copy-webpack-plugin` to copy the `locales` src directory to distribution directory.
  Then set the `devServer.contentBase` to the distribution directory.

  ```javascript
  const path = require('path');
  const CopyPlugin = require('copy-webpack-plugin');

  module.exports = function() {
    return {
      devServer: {
        contentBase: path.join(__dirname, "dist"),
      },
      plugins: [
        new CopyPlugin([
          { from: 'src/locales', to: 'locales' } // assumption: src/locales exists
        ])
      ]
    }
  }
  ```

## Using the plugin

If you are familiar with `aurelia-i18n` plugin, then you know that apart from translation service, this plugin also provides formatting service for number, date, and relative time.
All these features are also available in `@aurelia/i18n` which are elaborated in the following section.

### Translation

The translation service provided by this plugin can be used both in view (HTML), and view-model.

#### Translation in view
Aurelia uses an attribute pattern in view to replace the content or attribute values.
The default pattern is `t`, which can be customized by [registering aliases](#customize-translation-attribute-alias).
For the purpose this discussion though the default attribute is assumed.

##### Syntax

```html
<element t="[optional-attribute-list1]translation-key;[optional-attribute-list2]optional-translation-key"></element>
```
At minimum, a `translation-key` needs to be used as the value for `t` attribute.
The key can be preceded by a comma-separated list of attributes.
When specified, the value of those attributes are replaced with the value of the translation key.
Moreover, subsequent attribute list and key pairs can also be used in the same `t` attribute.
The following examples explain this in more details.

##### Replace `textContent`

This is the most common use-case, as well as the default behavior.

```json translation.json
{
  "key": "Hello World"
}
```

```html view.html
<span t="key"></span>
```
Given the above translation, and view, Aurelia replaces the `textContent` of the `span` with "Hello World".

##### Replace `[src]` of `<img>`

The aforementioned `t="key"` syntax behaves bit differently for `img` elements.
In this case, the `src` attribute of the `img` is replaced instead.

```json translation.json
{
  "key": "/path/to/image.jpg"
}
```

```html view.html
<img t="key">
```
`i18n` plugin transforms the `img` element to `<img src="/path/to/image.jpg">`.

##### Replace `innerHTML`

As told before, by default the plugin will set the `textContent` property of an element.

```json translation.json
{
  "title": "Title <b>bold</b>"
}
```

```html view.html
<span t="title">Title</span>
```

Therefore, in above example the html tags will be escaped and the output will be `&lt;b&gt;bold&lt;/b&gt;`.
To allow html-markup to be used, the `[html]` attribute needs to be added before the translation key.

```HTML
<span t="[html]title">Title</span>
```

This will set the `innerHTML` of the element instead of the `textContent` property, so html-markup won't be escaped.

##### `[append]` or `[prepend]` translations

So far we have seen that contents are replaced.
There are 2 special attributes `[append]`, and `[prepend]` which can be used to append or prepend content to the existing content of the element.

```json translation.json
{
  "pre": "tic ",
  "post": " toe",
}
```

```html view.html
<span t="[prepend]pre;[append]post">tac</span>
```

The example above produces `<span>tic tac toe</span>`.

##### Attribute translation

The plugin can be used to translate attributes of HTML elements.

```json translation.json
{
  "title": "some text",
}
```

```html view.html
<span t="[title]title"></span>
```

The example sets the `[title]` attribute of the `span`.
Some useful example would be to use the attribute translation to set the `[alt]` or `[title]` attributes of image.
Note that same key can also be used to target multiple attributes, for example: `<img t="[title,alt]key">`.

Similar syntax of attribute translation also works for translating `@bindable`s of custom elements.

```typescript custom-message.ts
import { bindable, customElement } from '@aurelia/runtime';.
import template from './custom-message.html';

@customElement({ name: 'custom-message', template })
export class CustomMessage {
  @bindable public message: string;
}
```
```html custom-message.html
<template>
  <span>${message}</span>
</template>
```

Use the custom element as follows.

```html view.html
<custom-message t="[message]bar"></custom-message>
```

This produces following result.
```html
<custom-message>
  <span>[TRANSLATED VALUE OF BAR KEY]</span>
</custom-message>
```

##### Manipulate translations with translation attribute
  - with options including some basic examples:
    - interpolation
    - context
    - pluralization
    - nesting
    - interval

## Migration Guide & Breaking Changes

- `I18N` --> `I18nService`
- Change in API: nf, df
- relative time format
  - method in `I18nService` instead of a full-fledged class
  - registering translation resources is not required
  - polyfill might be needed for the browsers, do not yet support `Intl.RelativeTimeFormat`
  - no 'now' for <1s time diff; treated as 1s
- All VCs are now signalable
