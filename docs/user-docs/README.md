# Introduction

## What is Aurelia?

**Aurelia is the web framework that feels native to the browser.** Built on web standards with zero overhead from virtual DOMs or magic abstractions, Aurelia delivers exceptional performance while keeping your code clean and maintainable.

**Why developers choose Aurelia:**
- **Efficient bundle sizes** with smart code splitting and async loading
- **Standards-based architecture** that leverages browser capabilities
- **TypeScript-first** with powerful dependency injection built-in
- **No breaking changes** since 2.0 - stable, production-ready platform

If you value web standards, performance, and developer experience over framework hype, Aurelia is built for you.

## Choose Your Path

## Why Aurelia Outperforms

### **Performance That Matters**
- **Direct DOM manipulation** - no virtual DOM overhead
- **Batched rendering** for optimal browser performance  
- **Efficient memory usage** - applications that don't drain batteries
- **Optimized bundle sizes** - smart code splitting and async loading

### **Standards-First Development**
- **Web Components foundation** - build for the future of the web
- **Modern JavaScript/TypeScript** - no proprietary abstractions
- **Seamless third-party integration** - works with any library
- **Future-proof architecture** - leverages browser capabilities

### **Developer Experience**
- **Powerful dependency injection** built-in, no external libraries needed
- **Two-way data binding** with unidirectional safety
- **Complete ecosystem** - routing, validation, i18n, testing, CLI
- **API stability** - no breaking changes since 2.0, stable production platform

### **Production Ready**
- **Used by enterprise companies** worldwide
- **MIT licensed** open-source with active development
- **Comprehensive testing tools** built-in
- **Strong TypeScript support** from day one

## Built for the Future of Web Development

Aurelia isn't chasing the latest trends - it's built on the fundamental technologies that power the web. By embracing web standards and leveraging browser capabilities, Aurelia applications are inherently future-proof and performant.

**Our focused approach means:**
- **Thoughtful feature development** - every addition serves a clear purpose
- **Direct access to the core team** - your feedback directly shapes the framework
- **Stable, reliable releases** - no breaking changes that disrupt your projects
- **Quality ecosystem** - carefully curated tools and plugins that work seamlessly together

## Direct DOM: Maximum Performance, Minimum Overhead

Aurelia delivers superior performance by working directly with the browser's DOM instead of creating unnecessary abstraction layers.

### **Why Direct DOM Wins**

**Performance Advantages:**
- **Zero virtual DOM overhead** - no diffing algorithms or reconciliation cycles
- **Faster rendering** - direct updates where they're needed
- **Smaller memory footprint** - no duplicate DOM trees in memory
- **Better battery life** - efficient resource usage on mobile devices

**Developer Benefits:**
- **Predictable behavior** - work directly with web platform APIs
- **Easier debugging** - inspect actual DOM elements, not virtual representations  
- **Better third-party integration** - no compatibility issues with DOM-based libraries
- **Standards-aligned** - leverage browser capabilities instead of fighting them

Modern browsers are incredibly fast at DOM manipulation. Aurelia's intelligent observation and batching system ensures you get maximum performance without the complexity and overhead of virtual DOM solutions.
