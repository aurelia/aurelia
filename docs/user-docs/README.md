## What is Aurelia?

Aurelia is an open-source, JavaScript, front-end platform, designed to enable you to easily build even the most demanding web, mobile, or desktop applications. Aurelia stands out for its commitment to open web standards and its no-nonsense, get-out-of-your-way conventions that enable vanilla JavaScript development. Of course, Aurelia is also packed full of features, performs at the highest standards, extensible to its core, and supports a fully-testable component-oriented design. But you knew all that already, didn't you? 😎 

To get started right now, jump to our Quick Start Guide, or read on to get more of an overview.

## Using the Docs

Welcome to the Aurelia docs! This is where you will find guides, tutorials, API documentation, examples, resources, and more. We recommend that you begin your journey in the "Getting Started" section with the [Quick Start Guide](getting-started/quick-start-guide/) where you will learn to build your first application and be introduced to the basics of Aurelia. After you complete the Quick Start, you should continue reading through the "Getting Started" section where you will learn the bulk of what is needed to get up and running with your own apps. Next, the "App Basics" section is filled with a variety of topics to help you begin to use Aurelia on a regular basis.

Once you feel more comfortable using the product, the "Advanced Scenarios" section covers performance optimization, large-scale projects, UI architecture, and more. There is also a detailed "API" reference for all of Aurelia's classes, methods, and properties, although it is likely that you will find that you will not need the raw API documentation as much as with other frameworks or libraries since Aurelia focuses on conventions and vanilla JavaScript. Instead, you might find the "Examples" section more helpful since it includes code samples for common scenarios that can be copied and pasted into your own app. Also, the "Resources" section includes a basic FAQ, information about browser support, versioning, comparisons to other frameworks and various other information you might find useful.

If you happen to find anything in the documentation that is incorrect or missing, every page has an "Edit on GitHub" link that you can use to easily report or correct the issue.
