# AUR0015

### **Error message**

`yyyy` is a native function and, therefore cannot be safely constructed by DI. If this is intentional, please use a callback or cachedCallback resolver.

### **Parameters**

name(string)

### Error explanation

A `container.invoke(key)` or `container.getFactory(key)` call happens with the key being one of the built-in types like `String`/`Number`/`Array`

### Possible solutions

Consider avoid using these keys for those calls

Please also note that this error could be caused by a plugin and not your application. After ruling out that the error is not being caused by your code, try removing any registered plugins one at a time to see if the error resolves itself.
