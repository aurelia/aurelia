description: Using middleware in Aurelia Store to make changes to actions

# Middleware

Middleware act as an intermediary step in your application to allow you to modify data in your store actions, before and after they have run. Think of middleware as a way to change data after an action has fired.

The Aurelia Store plugin comes with a couple of middleware out of the box for you to use, but you can easily create your own.
