# Joining the Community

**Welcome to the Aurelia community!** ðŸŽŠ 

If you are looking to ask basic questions, [please visit our Discourse forum](https://discourse.aurelia.io/). For a more chat-like experience, our Aurelia 2 community also [hangs out on Discord](https://discord.gg/fh72aCn).

This documentation on Aurelia 2 is still preliminary, but that doesn't mean you can't jump in and join us in building the world's most-loved JavaScript framework.

To get started working with us, please first read our [code of conduct](code-of-conduct.md) and our [contributor guide](contributor-guide.md). After that, if you want to contribute to the source code of Aurelia, its tools, or its plugins, have a read through [building and testing Aurelia](building-and-testing-aurelia.md). If you'd like to contribute to our documentation, then please take a look at [writing documentation](writing-documentation.md).

We look forward to working together with you!
