### **Error message**

Attempted to jitRegister an intrinsic type: `yyyy`. Did you forget to add @inject(Key)

### **Parameters**

Interface name

### Error explanation

A DI container is trying to resolve an instance of an interface, but there is no registration for it. This means the instance you are trying to load has not been registered with Dependency Injection.

### Possible solutions

Ensure that you are registering your interface with Aurelia. This can be done inside of the `register` method on the Aurelia instance or through the DI methods themselves.

Please also note that this error could be caused by a plugin and not your application. After ruling out that the error is not being caused by your code, try removing any registered plugins one at a time to see if the error resolves itself.
