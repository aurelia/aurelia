# AUR0002

### **Error message**

`yyyy` not registered, did you forget to add @singleton()?

### **Parameters**

Name of the key being resolved

### Error explanation

A DI container is trying to resolve a key, but there's not a known strategy for it.

### Possible solutions

Try adding a strategy for your resolved key. You can do this using `@singleton` or other forms of DI resolution

Please also note that this error could be caused by a plugin and not your application. After ruling out that the error is not being caused by your code, try removing any registered plugins one at a time to see if the error resolves itself.
