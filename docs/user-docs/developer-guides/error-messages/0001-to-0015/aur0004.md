# AUR0004

### **Error message**

Resolver for `yyyy` returned a null factory

### **Parameters**

String version of the key being resolved

### Error explanation

No factory was found for transient registration.

### Possible solutions

This means the transient registration you gave to a container wasn't with a proper factory registered along with it, consider using `container.registerFactory(IMyInterface, someFactoryObject)` to fix this issue.

Please also note that this error could be caused by a plugin and not your application. After ruling out that the error is not being caused by your code, try removing any registered plugins one at a time to see if the error resolves itself.
