### **Error message**

Unable to autoregister dependency: \[`yyyy`]

### **Parameters**

list of registering parameters

### Error explanation

This means during the registration of some value with a container, it has reached the depth 100, which is an extreme case, and is considered invalid.

### Possible solutions

Check your dependency graph, if it's really complex, which could happen over time, maybe inject a container and resolve the dependencies lazily instead, where possible.

Please also note that this error could be caused by a plugin and not your application. After ruling out that the error is not being caused by your code, try removing any registered plugins one at a time to see if the error resolves itself.
