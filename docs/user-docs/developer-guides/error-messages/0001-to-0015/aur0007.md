# AUR0007

### **Error message**

Invalid resolver strategy specified: `yyyy`

### **Parameters**

resource key

### Error explanation

This means there is a resource with that name already registered with a container

### Possible solutions

Consider using a different name for the resource (element/attribute/value converter/binding behavior etc...).

Please also note that this error could be caused by a plugin and not your application. After ruling out that the error is not being caused by your code, try removing any registered plugins one at a time to see if the error resolves itself.
