### **Error message**

Attempted to jitRegister something that is not a constructor: '`yyyy`'. Did you forget to register this resource?

### **Parameters**

key(any)

### Error explanation

This means a `container.get(key)` call happens without any prior knowledge for the container to resolve the `key` given. And the container is unable to instantiate this key as it's not a class (or a normal function).

### Possible solutions

Consider registering the key with the container, or parent or root containers before making the call.

Please also note that this error could be caused by a plugin and not your application. After ruling out that the error is not being caused by your code, try removing any registered plugins one at a time to see if the error resolves itself.
