### **Error message**

Attempted to jitRegister something that is not a constructor: '`yyyy`'. Did you forget to register this resource?

### **Parameters**

key(any)

### Error explanation

This means a `container.get(key)` call happens with key being built in type functions such as `String`/`Number`/`Array` etc.

### Possible solutions

This could happen from TS generated code where it fails to generate proper metadata, or forgotten registration, consider checking the output of TS when `emitDecoratorMetadata` is on, or remember to register a resolution for those built-in types.

Please also note that this error could be caused by a plugin and not your application. After ruling out that the error is not being caused by your code, try removing any registered plugins one at a time to see if the error resolves itself.
