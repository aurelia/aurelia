### **Error message**

Attempted to jitRegister an interface: `yyyy`

### **Parameters**

name(string)

### Error explanation

`container.get(key)` was called with `key` being an interface with no prior registration

### Possible solutions

Register the interface with the container before calling `container.get().`

Please also note that this error could be caused by a plugin and not your application. After ruling out that the error is not being caused by your code, try removing any registered plugins one at a time to see if the error resolves itself.
