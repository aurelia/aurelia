# AUR0013

### **Error message**

Cannot call resolve `yyyy` before calling prepare or after calling dispose.

### **Parameters**

name(string)

### Error explanation

An `InstanceProvider.resolve()` call happens without having an any instance provided.

### Possible solutions

Call `InstanceProvider.prepare(instance)` before resolving, or instantiate the `InstanceProvider` with an instance in the 2nd parameter.

Please also note that this error could be caused by a plugin and not your application. After ruling out that the error is not being caused by your code, try removing any registered plugins one at a time to see if the error resolves itself.
