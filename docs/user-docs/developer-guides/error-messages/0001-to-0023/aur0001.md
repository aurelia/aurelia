### **Error message**

No registration for interface: `xxxx`

### **Parameters**

Interface name

### Error explanation

This error occurs when Aurelia's Dependency Injection (DI) container is asked to resolve a dependency using an interface key (created via `DI.createInterface`) that has not been registered.

In Aurelia, an "interface" is not a TypeScript interface, but a unique symbol or key used to represent a contract for a dependency.

### Common causes

- You forgot to register the interface with the container.
- There is a typo in the interface key.
- A plugin or library expected to register the interface did not do so.

### How to fix

- Register the interface with the container, e.g. `container.register(MyInterface);`
- Double-check the key used in both registration and injection.
- If using plugins, ensure they are properly configured and registered.

### Debugging tips

- Check the stack trace to see where the resolution was attempted.
- Search your codebase for all registrations of the interface key.

### Possible solutions

Ensure that you are registering your interface with Aurelia. This can be done inside of the `register` method on the Aurelia instance or through the DI methods themselves.

Please also note that this error could be caused by a plugin and not your application. After ruling out that the error is not being caused by your code, try removing any registered plugins one at a time to see if the error resolves itself.
