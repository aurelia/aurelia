# AUR0002

### **Error message**

'xxxx' was registered with "none" resolver, are you injecting the right key?

### **Parameters**

Name of the key being resolved

### Error explanation

This error occurs when a key was registered with the "none" resolver, which means it is intentionally not resolvable from the DI container. This usually happens if you are trying to inject or resolve a key that was not meant to be resolved, or if there is a mismatch between the key you registered and the key you are trying to inject.

### Common causes

- You registered a key with the "none" resolver (e.g., for a marker or interface), but then tried to inject or resolve it.
- There is a typo or mismatch between the key you registered and the key you are injecting.
- You are using a plugin or library that registered a key with "none" resolver, but your code is trying to resolve it.

### How to fix

- Double-check the key you are injecting or resolving matches the key you registered.
- If you intended to resolve this key, register it with a proper resolver (e.g., `@singleton`, `@transient`, or a custom resolver).
- If you do not intend to resolve this key, remove the injection or resolution attempt.

### Debugging tips

- Check the stack trace to see where the resolution was attempted.
- Search your codebase for all registrations and injections of the key in question.
- If using plugins, check their documentation for expected registration patterns.
