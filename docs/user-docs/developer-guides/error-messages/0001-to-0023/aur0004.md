# AUR0004

### **Error message**

Resolver for `yyyy` returned a null factory

### **Parameters**

String version of the key being resolved

### Error explanation

This error occurs when the DI container tries to resolve a transient registration, but no factory was found for the given key. A factory is required to create new instances for transients, and if it is missing or not properly registered, this error will be thrown.

### Common causes

- You registered a transient dependency without providing a factory.
- The factory for the key was not registered correctly or was accidentally removed.
- There is a typo or mismatch in the key used for registration and resolution.
- A plugin or library expected to register the factory did not do so.

### How to fix

- Register a factory for the key using `container.registerFactory(IMyInterface, someFactoryObject)`.
- Double-check that the key used for registration matches the key used for resolution.
- Ensure that any plugins or libraries you are using are properly configured and registered.

### Debugging tips

- Check the stack trace to see where the resolution was attempted.
- Search your codebase for all registrations and resolutions of the key in question.
- If using plugins, try disabling them one at a time to isolate the source.
