### **Error message**

Unable to autoregister dependency: [`yyyy`]

### **Parameters**

List of registering parameters

### Error explanation

This error occurs when the DI container attempts to register dependencies recursively and exceeds a depth of 100. This is a safeguard to prevent infinite or excessively deep registration loops, which usually indicate a problem in your dependency graph or registration logic.

### Common causes

- Circular or overly complex dependency graphs causing recursive registration.
- Accidentally registering the same dependency multiple times in a loop.
- Plugins or libraries that register dependencies in a way that causes deep or infinite recursion.

### How to fix

- Review your dependency graph for cycles or excessive depth.
- Refactor your registrations to avoid deep or recursive registration patterns.
- Where possible, inject the container and resolve dependencies lazily instead of registering everything up front.
- If using plugins, ensure they are not causing recursive registrations.

### Debugging tips

- Check the stack trace to see where the registration loop is occurring.
- Search your codebase for recursive or repeated registration patterns.
- If using plugins, try disabling them one at a time to isolate the source.

Please also note that this error could be caused by a plugin and not your application. After ruling out that the error is not being caused by your code, try removing any registered plugins one at a time to see if the error resolves itself.
