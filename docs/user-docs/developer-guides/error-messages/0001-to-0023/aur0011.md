### **Error message**

Invalid resolver returned from the static register method

### Error explanation

This error occurs when a static `register` method on a resource or class returns `null` or `undefined` instead of a valid resolver. The DI container expects the `register` method to return a proper resolver object so it can manage the dependency.

### Common causes

- The static `register` method does not return anything or returns `null`/`undefined`.
- There is a bug or missing return statement in a custom resource or plugin's `register` method.
- A plugin or library is not implementing the `register` method correctly.

### How to fix

- Ensure that all static `register` methods return a valid resolver object.
- Double-check custom resources, plugins, or libraries for correct implementation of the `register` method.
- Add appropriate return statements to all `register` methods.

### Debugging tips

- Check the stack trace to see which `register` method caused the error.
- Search your codebase for all static `register` methods and verify their return values.
- If using plugins, try disabling them one at a time to isolate the source.

### Possible solutions

Check the `register` method on the `key.`

Please also note that this error could be caused by a plugin and not your application. After ruling out that the error is not being caused by your code, try removing any registered plugins one at a time to see if the error resolves itself.
