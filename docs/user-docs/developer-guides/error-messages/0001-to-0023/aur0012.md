### **Error message**

Attempted to jitRegister an interface: `yyyy`

### **Parameters**

name (string)

### Error explanation

This error occurs when the DI container tries to automatically register (jitRegister) an interface key (created with `DI.createInterface`) that has not been registered and does not have a default implementation. The container cannot instantiate interfaces directly, so you must provide a registration or a default implementation.

### Common causes

- Calling `container.get(key)` with an interface key that has not been registered.
- Forgetting to register the interface or provide a default implementation when creating the interface.
- A plugin or library expected to register the interface did not do so.

### How to fix

- Register the interface with the container before calling `container.get(key)`.
- When creating the interface with `DI.createInterface`, provide a default implementation if appropriate.
- Double-check that the key used for registration matches the key used for resolution.
- If using plugins or libraries, ensure they are properly configured and registered.

### Debugging tips

- Check the stack trace to see where the resolution was attempted.
- Search your codebase for all registrations and resolutions of the interface key in question.
- If using plugins, try disabling them one at a time to isolate the source.

Please also note that this error could be caused by a plugin and not your application. After ruling out that the error is not being caused by your code, try removing any registered plugins one at a time to see if the error resolves itself.
