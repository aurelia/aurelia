### **Error message**

key/value cannot be null or undefined. Are you trying to inject/register something that doesn't exist with DI?

### Error explanation

This error occurs when a `null` or `undefined` key is used in a DI container operation, such as `container.get(key)` or `container.register(key, ...)`. Dependency Injection keys must always be defined and valid.

### Common causes

- A circular dependency or bundler issue (e.g., Webpack) results in a key being `undefined` at runtime.
- A typo or incorrect import leads to a missing or undefined key.
- Attempting to register or resolve a dependency before it is defined.
- Plugins or libraries that incorrectly provide a null/undefined key.

### How to fix

- Ensure all keys used in DI registration and resolution are defined and not null/undefined.
- Check for circular dependencies in your module graph, especially with bundlers.
- Double-check imports and the order of registration.
- If using plugins, ensure they are not introducing null/undefined keys.

### Debugging tips

- Check the stack trace to see where the null/undefined key was used.
- Search your codebase for all registrations and resolutions of the key in question.
- If using a bundler, look for circular dependencies or import issues.
- If using plugins, try disabling them one at a time to isolate the source.
