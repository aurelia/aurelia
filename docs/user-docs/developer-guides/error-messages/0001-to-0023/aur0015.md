### **Error message**

`yyyy` is a native function and cannot be safely constructed by DI. If this is intentional, please use a callback or cachedCallback resolver.

### **Parameters**

name (string)

### Error explanation

This error occurs when you attempt to use the DI container to construct a native JavaScript built-in type (such as `String`, `Number`, `Array`, etc.) using `container.invoke(key)` or `container.getFactory(key)`. Native functions cannot be safely constructed by the DI system.

### Common causes

- Attempting to inject or construct a built-in type (like `String`, `Number`, `Array`, etc.) as a dependency.
- Accidentally passing a native function as a key to `container.invoke` or `container.getFactory`.
- Misconfiguration or missing `@inject` decorator for intrinsic types.

### How to fix

- Avoid using native JavaScript types as keys for DI construction.
- If you need to provide a value for a built-in type, use a callback or cachedCallback resolver to supply the value.
- Use the `@inject` decorator to specify the correct dependency key for intrinsic types.

### Debugging tips

- Check the stack trace to see where the native function is being constructed.
- Search your codebase for uses of `container.invoke` or `container.getFactory` with native types.
- Ensure all dependencies are registered with appropriate resolvers.

Please also note that this error could be caused by a plugin and not your application. After ruling out that the error is not being caused by your code, try removing any registered plugins one at a time to see if the error resolves itself.
