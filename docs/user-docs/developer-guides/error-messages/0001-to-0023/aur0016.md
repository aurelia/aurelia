### **Error message**

There is not a currently active container to resolve "yyyy". Are you trying to "new Class(...)" that has a resolve(...) call?

### **Parameters**

Key being resolved (string)

### Error explanation

This error occurs when a call to `resolve(key)` is made, but there is no active DI container context. This typically happens if you try to use `resolve()` outside of a class or function that is being constructed or invoked by the DI system, or if you attempt to use `resolve()` in a static context or after the container has been disposed.

### Common causes

- Calling `resolve()` outside of a DI-managed context (e.g., in a static method, global scope, or after manual instantiation).
- Attempting to use `resolve()` in a class that was created with `new` instead of being resolved by the container.
- The container has already been disposed or is not set up correctly.

### How to fix

- Ensure you are only calling `resolve()` within constructors or methods that are managed by the DI container.
- Use the DI container to instantiate classes that require dependency resolution, rather than using `new` directly.
- Check that the container is properly set up and has not been disposed before calling `resolve()`.

### Debugging tips

- Check the stack trace to see where `resolve()` was called without an active container.
- Search your codebase for direct calls to `resolve()` and ensure they are within DI-managed contexts.
- If using plugins, try disabling them one at a time to isolate the source.
