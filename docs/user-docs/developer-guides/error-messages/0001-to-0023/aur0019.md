### **Error message**

Invalid channel name or type: yyyy.

### **Parameters**

Channel name or type (string or constructor)

### Error explanation

This error occurs when you attempt to subscribe to an event in the EventAggregator using an invalid channel name (such as `undefined`, `null`, or an invalid type). The EventAggregator expects a valid string channel name or a constructor function for message types.

### Common causes

- Passing `undefined`, `null`, or an invalid value as the channel or type to `subscribe()` or `subscribeOnce()`.
- Typo or incorrect variable used for the channel name or type.
- Attempting to subscribe before the channel or type is defined or available.

### How to fix

- Ensure you are passing a valid string or constructor as the channel or type when subscribing.
- Double-check for typos or incorrect variables in your subscription code.
- Make sure the channel or type is defined and available before subscribing.

### Debugging tips

- Check the stack trace to see where the invalid subscription was attempted.
- Search your codebase for all calls to `subscribe()` and `subscribeOnce()` in the EventAggregator.
- If using plugins, try disabling them one at a time to isolate the source.
