### **Error message**

No defined value found when calling firstDefined()

### **Parameters**

None

### Error explanation

This error occurs when the `firstDefined()` utility function is called with a list of values, but none of the values are defined (i.e., all are `undefined`). The function is intended to return the first non-undefined value, and throws this error if none is found.

### Common causes

- All arguments passed to `firstDefined()` are `undefined`.
- There is a logic error in the code that generates the values for `firstDefined()`.
- The function is used in a context where at least one value should always be defined, but none are.

### How to fix

- Ensure that at least one argument passed to `firstDefined()` is defined (not `undefined`).
- Check the logic that produces the values for `firstDefined()` to ensure it is working as expected.
- Add appropriate fallbacks or default values if necessary.

### Debugging tips

- Check the stack trace to see where `firstDefined()` was called.
- Inspect the values being passed to `firstDefined()` at the point of the error.
- Add logging or breakpoints to verify the expected values are present.
