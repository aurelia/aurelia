### **Error message**

Invalid module transform input: yyyy. Expected Promise or Object.

### **Parameters**

Input value (any)

### Error explanation

This error occurs when a module loader or transformer receives an input that is neither a Promise nor an Object. The module loader expects to work with either a module object or a Promise that resolves to a module, and will throw this error if given an invalid type (such as a string, number, or null).

### Common causes

- Passing a primitive value (string, number, boolean, etc.) instead of a module or Promise to a module loader or transformer.
- Accidentally passing `null` or `undefined` as the input.
- Misconfigured dynamic import or require call.

### How to fix

- Ensure you are passing either a module object or a Promise that resolves to a module.
- Check the value being passed to the module loader or transformer for typos or incorrect types.
- If using dynamic imports, verify that the import or require call returns a Promise or module object.

### Debugging tips

- Check the stack trace to see where the invalid input was provided.
- Add logging or breakpoints to inspect the value being passed to the module loader or transformer.
- Review the code that constructs or imports modules to ensure correct types are used.
