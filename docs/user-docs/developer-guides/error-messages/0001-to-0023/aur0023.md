### **Error message**

Resource key '{{0}}' has already been registered.

### **Parameters**

Resource key (string)

### Error explanation

This error occurs when you attempt to register a resource (such as a custom element, attribute, value converter, or binding behavior) with a key that has already been registered in the container. Resource keys must be unique within a container.

### Common causes

- Attempting to register the same resource more than once.
- Using the same name for multiple resources of the same type.
- A plugin or library is registering a resource with a name that conflicts with one in your application.

### How to fix

- Use unique names for your resources (elements, attributes, value converters, binding behaviors, etc.).
- Check for duplicate registrations in your code and in any plugins you are using.
- If a plugin is causing the conflict, consult its documentation or consider renaming your resource.

### Debugging tips

- Check the stack trace to see where the duplicate registration is occurring.
- Search your codebase for all registrations of the resource key in question.
- If using plugins, try disabling them one at a time to isolate the source.
