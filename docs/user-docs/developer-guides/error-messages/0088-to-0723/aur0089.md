# AUR0089

### **Error message**

Attribute pattern "{{0}}" has already been registered.

### **Parameters**

1.  `pattern`: The duplicate pattern string that was attempted to be registered.

### Error explanation

This error occurs when you attempt to register an attribute pattern string with the `IAttributeParser` that has already been registered. Each pattern string must be unique.

### Common causes

- Defining the same pattern string in multiple `@attributePattern` decorators or calls to `IAttributeParser.registerPattern`.
- Accidentally providing the same `AttributePatternDefinition` object multiple times during registration.
- A plugin or library registering a pattern that conflicts with one already defined in your application or another plugin.

### How to fix

- Ensure each attribute pattern string defined in your application and plugins is unique.
- Check for duplicate pattern definitions in your codebase.
- If a conflict exists with a third-party plugin, consider renaming your pattern or contacting the plugin author.

### Debugging tips

- Identify the duplicate pattern string from the error message.
- Search your codebase and dependencies for where this pattern string is defined and registered.
- Temporarily remove or comment out pattern registrations to isolate the source of the duplication.
