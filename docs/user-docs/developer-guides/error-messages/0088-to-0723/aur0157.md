### **Error message**

Binding command {{0}} has already been registered.

### **Parameters**

1.  `name`: The name of the binding command that already exists.

### Error explanation

This warning occurs when you attempt to register a binding command with a name that has already been registered in the container. Binding command names must be unique. While this is currently a warning (`console.warn`), it indicates a potential issue where the intended binding command might be overridden.

### Common causes

- Registering the same binding command class multiple times.
- Defining multiple binding commands with the same name.
- A plugin or library registering a binding command with a name that conflicts with one in your application.

### How to fix

- Ensure each binding command has a unique name.
- Check for duplicate registrations in your code and in any plugins you are using.
- If a plugin is causing the conflict, consult its documentation or consider renaming your binding command.

### Debugging tips

- Identify the duplicate binding command name from the warning message.
- Search your codebase and dependencies for where binding commands with this name are defined and registered.
- Temporarily remove or comment out binding command registrations to isolate the source of the duplication.
