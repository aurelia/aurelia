# AUR0101: Binding Behavior Not Found

## Error Message

`AUR0101: Ast eval error: binding behavior "{{name}}" could not be found. Did you forget to register it as a dependency?`

## Description

This error occurs during binding expression evaluation when a binding behavior (used via `& someBehavior`) cannot be found in the current registration scope.

## Solution

- Ensure the binding behavior is registered (globally via `Aurelia.register(...)` or locally via a component’s `dependencies`).
- Check for typos in the behavior name used in the template.

## More Information

This code is also documented under the runtime-html section: [AUR0101](../runtime-html/aur0101.md).
