# AUR0204: Create Scope With Null Context

## Error Message

`AUR0204: Trying to create a scope with null/undefined binding context`

## Description

This error occurs when Aurelia tries to create a binding scope but the binding context is `null` or `undefined`. This typically indicates a lifecycle/timing issue or a missing view-model/binding context in a composition scenario.

## Common Scenarios

- Creating/binding a view before its view-model is available.
- Manually composing a view with an invalid context.

## Solutions

- Ensure the component/view-model exists before binding begins.
- For async composition, wait for the promise to resolve before starting/binding.

## Troubleshooting

- Check the stack trace for where scope creation is triggered.
- Verify any custom rendering/composition code passes a valid binding context.
