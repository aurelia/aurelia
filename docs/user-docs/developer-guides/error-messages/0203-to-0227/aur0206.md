# AUR0206: Switch On Null Connectable

## Error Message

`AUR0206: Trying to switch to a null/undefined connectable`

## Description

This error occurs when Aurelia’s internal connectable switcher is asked to switch to a connectable (an object participating in observation/connection) but the provided connectable is `null` or `undefined`.

## Example Trigger

This is usually caused by a bug in custom observer/connectable integrations or a lifecycle ordering issue where a connectable is disposed while still being used.

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure custom connectable implementations are created before use and not cleared too early.
- If you can reproduce this in a minimal example, please report it as it may indicate an Aurelia bug.
