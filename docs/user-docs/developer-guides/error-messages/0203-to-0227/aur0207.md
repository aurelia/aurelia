# AUR0207: Switch Active Connectable

## Error Message

`AUR0207: Trying to enter an active connectable`

## Description

This error occurs when the connectable switcher attempts to enter a connectable that is already active. This usually indicates mismatched enter/exit calls (for example, entering twice without exiting).

## Troubleshooting

- Check custom observation code for balanced enter/exit calls.
- If this occurs without custom integrations, please report it with a reproduction.
