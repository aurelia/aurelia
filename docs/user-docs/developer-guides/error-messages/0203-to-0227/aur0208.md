# AUR0208: Switch Off Null Connectable

## Error Message

`AUR0208: Trying to pop a null/undefined connectable`

## Description

This error occurs when the connectable switcher attempts to exit/pop a connectable, but the current connectable is unexpectedly `null` or `undefined`.

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure connectable enter/exit calls are correctly paired.
- If you are using custom observation/connectable logic, verify it does not clear internal state prematurely.
