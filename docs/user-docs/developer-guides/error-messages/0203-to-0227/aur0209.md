# AUR0209: Switch Off Inactive Connectable

## Error Message

`AUR0209: Trying to exit an inactive connectable`

## Description

This error occurs when the connectable switcher attempts to exit a connectable that is not currently active. This typically indicates an imbalance in the internal connectable stack (exiting more times than entering).

## Troubleshooting

- Review custom observation/connectable integrations for balanced enter/exit usage.
- If no custom integrations are involved, this may indicate an Aurelia bug; please report it with a reproduction.
