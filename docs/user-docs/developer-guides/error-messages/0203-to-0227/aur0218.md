# AUR0218: Dirty Check Not Allowed

## Error Message

`AUR0218: Dirty checked is not permitted in this application. Property key {{property}} is being dirty checked.`

Where `{{property}}` is the property key Aurelia attempted to dirty check.

## Description

This error occurs when dirty checking is disabled in the application configuration, but a binding attempts to fall back to dirty checking for a property.

## Solutions

- Enable dirty checking (if acceptable for your app) or adjust bindings so they can be observed via normal observers.
- Prefer observable properties/standard observable patterns over relying on dirty checking.

## Troubleshooting

- Identify which binding/property is causing the dirty check attempt (see `{{property}}`).
- Check whether the property is observable in your current platform/environment.
