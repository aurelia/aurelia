# AUR0219: Dirty Check Setter Not Allowed

## Error Message

`AUR0219: Trying to set value for property {{property}} in dirty checker`

Where `{{property}}` is the property being set.

## Description

This error occurs when code attempts to set a value through a dirty-checking observer in a way that is not allowed by the dirty checker implementation.

## Troubleshooting

- Avoid writing to values through dirty-checking observers; prefer normal property setters/observers.
- If you encounter this without custom observation code, please report it with a reproduction.
