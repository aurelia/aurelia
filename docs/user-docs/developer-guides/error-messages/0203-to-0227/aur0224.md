# AUR0224: Invalid `@observable` Decorator Usage

## Error Message

`AUR0224: Invalid @observable decorator usage, cannot determine property name`

## Description

This error occurs when Aurelia cannot determine the property name for an `@observable` decorator usage. This is usually caused by applying `@observable` in an unsupported way or in an environment that does not provide the required decorator metadata.

## Common Scenarios

- Using `@observable` without proper TypeScript decorator configuration.
- Applying `@observable` to an unsupported target (for example not a class field/property in the expected form).

## Solution

- Ensure your project is configured for decorators as required by Aurelia.
- Apply `@observable` to a class field/property as supported by your build setup.

## Troubleshooting

- Verify your TypeScript/bundler configuration for decorators.
- Check that the decorator is applied to a class field and not a local variable or unsupported construct.
