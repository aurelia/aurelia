# AUR0905

### **Error message**

Dialog activation rejected

### **Parameters**

None

### Error explanation

This error is thrown as a rejection from the `dialogController.closed` promise when the dialog's activation is prevented by its `canActivate` hook, and the `rejectOnCancel` setting is true for the dialog.

### Common causes

- The `canActivate` hook in the dialog component returned `false` or a promise that resolved to `false`.
- The `rejectOnCancel` setting was set to `true` either globally or in the specific dialog settings.

### How to fix

- **Handle the rejection:** Catch the rejection from the `dialogController.closed` promise (or the `dialogService.open()` promise).
- **Review `canActivate`:** Ensure the `canActivate` logic is correct and only returns `false` when activation should truly be prevented.
- **Review `rejectOnCancel`:** Consider if `rejectOnCancel: true` is the desired behavior. If activation rejection should not be treated as an error, set `rejectOnCancel` to `false` (the default). In this case, the `dialogService.open()` promise will resolve with `{ wasCancelled: true, dialog: dialogController }`.

### Debugging tips

- Check the `canActivate` method of the dialog component.
- Verify the value of the `rejectOnCancel` setting (globally and locally for the dialog).
- Use a `.catch()` block on the promise returned by `dialogService.open()` or `dialogController.closed` to inspect the rejected error.
