# AUR0906

### **Error message**

Dialog cancellation rejected

### **Parameters**

None

### Error explanation

This error is thrown as a rejection from the `dialogController.closed` promise when the dialog's deactivation (cancellation) is prevented by its `canDeactivate` hook, and the `rejectOnCancel` setting is true for the dialog.

### Common causes

- The `canDeactivate` hook in the dialog component returned `false` or a promise that resolved to `false`.
- The `rejectOnCancel` setting was set to `true` either globally or in the specific dialog settings.

### How to fix

- **Handle the rejection:** Catch the rejection from the `dialogController.closed` promise.
- **Review `canDeactivate`:** Ensure the `canDeactivate` logic is correct and only returns `false` when deactivation should truly be prevented.
- **Review `rejectOnCancel`:** Consider if `rejectOnCancel: true` is the desired behavior. If deactivation rejection should not be treated as an error, set `rejectOnCancel` to `false` (the default). In this case, the `dialogController.cancel()` promise will resolve with `{ status: 'abort' }`.

### Debugging tips

- Check the `canDeactivate` method of the dialog component.
- Verify the value of the `rejectOnCancel` setting (globally and locally for the dialog).
- Use a `.catch()` block on the promise returned by `dialogController.closed` to inspect the rejected error.
- Verify the logic calling `dialogController.cancel()` or triggering the cancel action (e.g., pressing ESC, clicking overlay).
