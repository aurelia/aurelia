### **Error message**

Dialog cancelled with a rejection on cancel

### **Parameters**

None

### Error explanation

This error is thrown as a rejection from the `dialogController.closed` promise when the dialog is closed normally (e.g., via `ok()`, `cancel()`, keyboard, overlay click), but the `rejectOnCancel` setting is true for the dialog.

This setting causes *any* normal closure (ok or cancel, but not `error()`) to be treated as a rejection of the `dialogController.closed` promise.

### Common causes

- The `rejectOnCancel` setting was set to `true` either globally or in the specific dialog settings.
- The dialog was closed normally (not via `dialogController.error()`).

### How to fix

- **Handle the rejection:** Catch the rejection from the `dialogController.closed` promise.
- **Review `rejectOnCancel`:** Consider if `rejectOnCancel: true` is the desired behavior. If normal dialog closure should resolve the promise instead of rejecting it, set `rejectOnCancel` to `false` (the default).

### Debugging tips

- Verify the value of the `rejectOnCancel` setting (globally and locally for the dialog).
- Use a `.catch()` block on the promise returned by `dialogController.closed` to inspect the rejected error. The error object will have a `wasCancelled: true` property, and the `value` property will contain the output passed to `ok()` or `cancel()`.
- Check the logic that closes the dialog (e.g., calls to `ok()`, `cancel()`, keyboard handlers, overlay dismiss handlers).
