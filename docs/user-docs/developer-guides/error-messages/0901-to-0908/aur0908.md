### **Error message**

Dialog custom error

### **Parameters**

None. The actual error value is attached to the rejection.

### Error explanation

This error is thrown as a rejection from the `dialogController.closed` promise when the dialog is closed using the `dialogController.error(value)` method. This method is intended for closing the dialog due to an application-specific error condition.

The error object thrown will have a `wasCancelled: false` property, and the `value` property will contain the value passed to the `error()` method.

### Common causes

- Explicitly calling `dialogController.error(someValue)` to indicate an error state.

### How to fix

- **Handle the rejection:** Catch the rejection from the `dialogController.closed` promise. Inspect the `value` property of the caught error to understand the specific reason passed to `error()`.
- **Review the calling code:** Ensure that `dialogController.error()` is being called appropriately for actual error conditions.

### Debugging tips

- Use a `.catch()` block on the promise returned by `dialogController.closed` to inspect the rejected error and its `value` property.
- Set breakpoints in the code that calls `dialogController.error()` to understand the context.
