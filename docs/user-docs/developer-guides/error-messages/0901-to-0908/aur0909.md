# AUR0909: Dialog Closed Before Deactivation

## Error Message

`AUR0909: Dialog was closed before deactivation, did you call dialog.close()?`

## Description

This error occurs when a dialog is closed (or the host is torn down) before the dialog controller finishes its deactivation lifecycle. In practice, this usually means `dialog.close()` (or equivalent) was invoked at a time that conflicts with the dialog’s normal close/deactivate flow.

## Common Scenarios

- Calling `dialogController.close()` from inside `deactivate()` or during an in-progress deactivate transition.
- Closing the dialog while the app is being deactivated/disposed.
- A custom renderer/host removes dialog DOM early.

## Solution

- Avoid closing a dialog from within its own deactivation lifecycle.
- If you need to close from code, trigger close from user action or a safe lifecycle point (for example after activation/binding).
- Ensure custom renderers/hosts do not remove dialog content before the controller completes deactivation.

## Troubleshooting

- Check stack traces for where `close()` is called.
- If the app is shutting down, ensure dialogs are closed in an orderly way (for example await close results before disposing).
