# AUR0910: Child Dialog Settings Not Found

## Error Message

`AUR0910: Child dialog settings not found for the given key {{key}}`

Where `{{key}}` is the key used to look up the child dialog settings.

## Description

This error occurs when the dialog system attempts to resolve settings for a child dialog (for example from a parent dialog context) but cannot find any settings registered for the provided key.

## Common Scenarios

- Passing an incorrect/unknown key when opening a child dialog.
- Losing dialog context between parent/child dialogs.
- Custom dialog configuration code not registering child settings.

## Solution

- Verify the key used to open the child dialog matches the key used when registering/creating the child settings.
- Ensure the dialog configuration/renderer you use supports child dialog settings and that it is properly registered.

## Troubleshooting

- Log the key value (`{{key}}`) and search for where it is registered.
- Reproduce with a minimal dialog setup to confirm whether the issue is in custom integration code.
