# AUR4107: GroupRule No Scope

## Error Message

`AUR4107: GroupRule cannot be executed without a scope.`

## Description

This error occurs when a `GroupRule` is executed without the required `scope` context.

## Example Trigger

This is typically caused by calling low-level rule execution APIs without providing a validation scope.

## Solution

- Execute group rules via the standard validation pipeline (for example via a `ValidationController`) so the scope is provided.
- If you are using lower-level APIs, ensure you pass a valid scope when executing rules.

## Troubleshooting

- Check where the rule is executed and verify a scope is available and passed through.
- Prefer higher-level validation APIs unless you are building a custom validation integration.
