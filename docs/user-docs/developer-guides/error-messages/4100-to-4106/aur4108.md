# AUR4108: GroupRule Invalid Execution Result

## Error Message

`AUR4108: GroupRule execution result is invalid.`

## Description

This error occurs when a `GroupRule` returns an unexpected result shape from execution (for example, missing expected fields or returning a non-boolean/non-result type where a result is required).

## Example Trigger

This is most often caused by a custom rule implementation returning an invalid value.

## Solution

- Ensure custom/group rule implementations return the expected validation result type.
- If a rule is async, return a `Promise` that resolves to a valid result.

## Troubleshooting

- Log the value returned by the failing rule to see what is being produced.
- Review custom rules for correct return types and error handling.
