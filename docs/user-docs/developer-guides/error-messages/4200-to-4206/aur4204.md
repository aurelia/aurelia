# AUR4204: Validate Binding Behavior Invalid Binding Target

## Error Message

`AUR4204: Invalid binding target`

## Description

This error occurs when the `& validate` binding behavior cannot determine a valid binding target (the element/property it should validate). This typically indicates the binding is not attached to a supported form control target or the binding is in an unexpected state.

## Common Scenarios

- Applying `& validate` to a binding that does not map to a real DOM target property.
- Using `& validate` on a custom binding setup where the underlying target cannot be resolved.
- A custom element/attribute produces an unexpected binding target shape.

## Solution

- Use `& validate` on standard form control property bindings (for example `value.bind`, `checked.bind`).
- Ensure the binding is targeting a real element property and the element exists at bind time.
- If using custom components, ensure they expose a bindable that maps to a real input value/checked state (or validate programmatically via a `ValidationController`).

## Troubleshooting

- Confirm the binding is a property binding on a form control element.
- Inspect the rendered DOM to ensure the element exists and the binding is applied where you expect.
- If the binding is created by a custom attribute/behavior, verify it produces a valid binding target.
