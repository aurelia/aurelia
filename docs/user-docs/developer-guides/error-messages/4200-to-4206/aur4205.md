# AUR4205: Validation Controller Unknown Expression

## Error Message

`AUR4205: Unknown expression of type {{type}}`

Where `{{type}}` is the runtime expression type encountered by the validation controller.

## Description

This error occurs when the validation controller encounters a binding/expression shape that it does not understand or cannot work with. This typically happens when using validation with an unsupported binding expression type or a custom/extended expression that the controller cannot interpret.

## Common Scenarios

- Using validation APIs against a binding that is not a standard property binding.
- Custom expression transforms/plugins that produce expression nodes the validation controller does not recognize.

## Solution

- Use validation with standard property bindings, or validate programmatically using a supported API.
- If you are extending expression parsing/compilation, ensure your extensions are compatible with validation-html.

## Troubleshooting

- Capture/log the expression type shown in `{{type}}` and locate where it originates.
- Reduce the binding to a simple `value.bind`/`checked.bind` and re-introduce complexity to find the incompatible part.
