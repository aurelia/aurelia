# AUR2000: Router Already Started

## Error Message

`AUR2000: Router.start() called while the it has already been started.`

## Description

This error occurs when you attempt to start the Aurelia router when it has already been started. The router can only be started once during the application lifecycle, and subsequent calls to `router.start()` will throw this error.

## Cause

The most common causes of this error are:

1. **Multiple Router Initialization:** Calling `router.start()` multiple times in your application code
2. **Plugin Conflicts:** Multiple plugins or libraries attempting to start the router independently
3. **Hot Module Replacement (HMR):** During development with HMR, the router might be started multiple times without proper cleanup
4. **Manual Router Management:** Manually calling `router.start()` when Aurelia has already started the router automatically

## Solution

### Check Router State Before Starting

Before calling `router.start()`, check if the router is already active:

```typescript
import { IRouter } from '@aurelia/router';

export class MyApp {
  constructor(private router: IRouter) {}

  async attached() {
    // Check if router is already active before starting
    if (!this.router.isActive) {
      this.router.start();
    }
  }
}
```

### Use Aurelia's Built-in Router Initialization

In most cases, you should let Aurelia handle router initialization automatically. Avoid manually calling `router.start()` unless you have a specific need:

```typescript
// ❌ Avoid manual router starting in most cases
export class MyApp {
  constructor(private router: IRouter) {
    this.router.start(); // This might cause AUR2000 if already started
  }
}

// ✅ Let Aurelia handle router initialization
export class MyApp {
  // Router is automatically started by Aurelia
}
```

### Proper Router Configuration

Configure the router in your main application setup instead of starting it manually:

```typescript
// main.ts
import { Aurelia } from 'aurelia';
import { RouterConfiguration } from '@aurelia/router';

Aurelia
  .register(RouterConfiguration)
  .app(MyApp)
  .start();
```

### Handle HMR Scenarios

If you're experiencing this error during development with Hot Module Replacement, ensure proper cleanup:

```typescript
export class MyApp {
  constructor(private router: IRouter) {}

  detaching() {
    // Ensure router is stopped when component is detached
    if (this.router.isActive) {
      this.router.stop();
    }
  }
}
```

## Debugging Tips

1. **Check Application Lifecycle:** Verify that you're not calling `router.start()` in multiple places in your application
2. **Review Plugin Configuration:** If using router-related plugins, ensure they're not conflicting with each other
3. **Inspect Router State:** Use `router.isActive` to check the current state of the router before attempting to start it
4. **Development Tools:** In development mode, check the browser console for any previous router-related errors that might indicate why the router was already started
