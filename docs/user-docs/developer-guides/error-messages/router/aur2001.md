# AUR2001: Router Not Started

## Error Message

`AUR2001: Router.stop() has been called while it has not been started`

## Description

This error occurs when you attempt to stop the Aurelia router when it has not been started yet. The router must be in an active state (started) before it can be stopped.

## Cause

The most common causes of this error are:

1. **Premature Router Stop:** Calling `router.stop()` before the router has been started
2. **Double Stop:** Calling `router.stop()` multiple times without restarting the router
3. **Incorrect Lifecycle Management:** Stopping the router at the wrong point in the application lifecycle
4. **Plugin or Library Issues:** Third-party code attempting to stop a router that was never started

## Solution

### Check Router State Before Stopping

Before calling `router.stop()`, verify that the router is currently active:

```typescript
import { IRouter } from '@aurelia/router-direct';

export class MyApp {
  constructor(private router: IRouter) {}

  async detaching() {
    // Check if router is active before stopping
    if (this.router.isActive) {
      this.router.stop();
    }
  }
}
```

### Proper Router Lifecycle Management

Ensure you follow the correct router lifecycle pattern:

```typescript
export class MyApp {
  constructor(private router: IRouter) {}

  async attached() {
    // Start the router if not already active
    if (!this.router.isActive) {
      this.router.start();
    }
  }

  async detaching() {
    // Stop the router if it's active
    if (this.router.isActive) {
      this.router.stop();
    }
  }
}
```

### Use Router State Property

Always check the router's `isActive` property to determine its current state:

```typescript
export class RouterManager {
  constructor(private router: IRouter) {}

  public safeStop(): void {
    if (this.router.isActive) {
      console.log('Stopping active router...');
      this.router.stop();
    } else {
      console.log('Router is not active, no need to stop');
    }
  }

  public safeStart(): void {
    if (!this.router.isActive) {
      console.log('Starting inactive router...');
      this.router.start();
    } else {
      console.log('Router is already active');
    }
  }
}
```

### Avoid Manual Router Management

In most Aurelia applications, you should let the framework handle router lifecycle automatically:

```typescript
// ❌ Avoid manual router lifecycle management unless necessary
export class MyApp {
  constructor(private router: IRouter) {}

  someMethod() {
    this.router.stop(); // This might cause AUR2001 if router wasn't started
  }
}

// ✅ Let Aurelia handle router lifecycle
export class MyApp {
  // Router lifecycle is managed automatically by Aurelia
}
```

## Debugging Tips

1. **Trace Router Lifecycle:** Add logging to track when `router.start()` and `router.stop()` are called
2. **Check Application Flow:** Verify that your application logic doesn't attempt to stop the router before starting it
3. **Review Component Lifecycle:** Ensure router stop calls are in appropriate lifecycle hooks (like `detaching` or `dispose`)
4. **Inspect Router State:** Use `router.isActive` to debug the current router state at any point

## Example: Safe Router Management

```typescript
export class RouterService {
  private isInitialized = false;

  constructor(private router: IRouter) {}

  public async initialize(): Promise<void> {
    if (!this.isInitialized && !this.router.isActive) {
      this.router.start();
      this.isInitialized = true;
      console.log('Router initialized successfully');
    }
  }

  public async cleanup(): Promise<void> {
    if (this.isInitialized && this.router.isActive) {
      this.router.stop();
      this.isInitialized = false;
      console.log('Router cleaned up successfully');
    }
  }

  public get isRouterReady(): boolean {
    return this.isInitialized && this.router.isActive;
  }
}
```
