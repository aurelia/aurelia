# AUR3155: RouteContext Resolution Failed

## Error Message

`AUR3155: Failed to resolve RouteContext from node %s; error: %s`

## Description

This error is logged when the router attempts to resolve a `RouteContext` from a DOM node, but resolution fails (for example because the node is not associated with an Aurelia controller or an unexpected error occurs while walking up the tree).

## Example Trigger

- Passing a DOM node outside of the Aurelia app to an API that tries to resolve `RouteContext`.

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure the node you pass is part of the Aurelia app’s DOM.
- If you are manipulating the DOM directly, prefer router/Aurelia composition APIs so controller associations are preserved.
- Inspect the second `%s` value (the error) for the underlying cause.
