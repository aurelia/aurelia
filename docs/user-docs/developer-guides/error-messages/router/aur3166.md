# AUR3166: Eager Path Generation Failed

## Error Message

`AUR3166: Unable to eagerly generate path for %s; reasons: %s`

## Description

This error occurs when the router tries to generate a URL path eagerly (without performing navigation) but cannot do so for the provided instruction.

## Common Scenarios

- An instruction references a component/route that cannot be resolved in the current `RouteContext`.
- Required parameters are missing or invalid.

## Solutions

- Ensure the component/route referenced by the instruction is registered/available in the current routing context.
- Validate route parameters and ensure required ones are supplied.

## Troubleshooting

- Inspect the “reasons” value for additional details.
- Try generating the path from a context where the route is known (for example from within the same routed component tree).
