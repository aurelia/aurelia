# AUR3168: Root RouteContext Already Registered

## Error Message

`AUR3168: A root RouteContext is already registered. A possible cause is the RouterConfiguration being registered more than once in the same container tree. If you have a multi-rooted app, make sure you register RouterConfiguration only in the "forked" containers and not in the common root.`

## Description

This error occurs when the router attempts to register a root `RouteContext` but finds one already registered. The most common cause is registering router configuration more than once in the same DI container tree.

## Solutions

- Ensure `RouterConfiguration` is only registered once per container tree.
- For multi-root apps, register router configuration in forked containers, not the shared root container.

## Troubleshooting

- Search for multiple registrations of router configuration/plugins.
- Check plugin setup and ensure it isn’t installed twice.
