# AUR3169: IAppRoot Has No Controller Yet

## Error Message

`AUR3169: The provided IAppRoot does not (yet) have a controller. A possible cause is calling this API manually before Aurelia.start() is called`

## Description

This error occurs when router APIs that rely on the root controller are invoked before the app has started (before `Aurelia.start()` creates/attaches the root controller).

## Solutions

- Delay router usage until after `Aurelia.start()` resolves.
- In app startup, avoid calling router navigation APIs before the app is started.

## Troubleshooting

- If you call router APIs during bootstrap, ensure they run after `await aurelia.start()`.
