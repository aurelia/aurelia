# AUR3170: Invalid Context Type

## Error Message

`AUR3170: Invalid context type: %s`

## Description

This error occurs when a router API receives a “context” argument of an unsupported type (for example something other than a `RouteContext`, controller, view-model, or DOM node where one is expected).

## Solutions

- Pass a supported context type for the API you are calling.
- If you intended to pass a DOM node, ensure it is actually a node.

## Troubleshooting

- Inspect the `%s` value in the error to see what type was provided.
