# AUR3174: No Available ViewportAgent

## Error Message

```text
AUR3174: Failed to resolve %s at:
%s
```

## Description

This error occurs when the router cannot resolve a suitable viewport agent for a navigation request, often because no viewport is available that matches the instruction, or the router tree is not in the expected state.

## Solutions

- Ensure the app has an active viewport setup that can host the navigation target.
- Ensure the requested viewport name(s) match what is configured in the view.

## Troubleshooting

- Review the printed tree/path in the error for where resolution failed.
- Verify viewport names and router configuration.
