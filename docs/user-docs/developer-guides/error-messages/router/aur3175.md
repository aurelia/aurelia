# AUR3175: Invalid Lazy Import Component

## Error Message

`AUR3175: %s does not appear to be a component or CustomElement recognizable by Aurelia; make sure to use the @customElement decorator for your class if not using conventions.`

## Description

This error occurs when a lazy import resolves to something that the router cannot treat as a component/custom element (for example, the module does not export a custom element, or the class is missing `@customElement` and conventions are not enabled).

## Solutions

- Ensure the imported module exports a custom element view-model (or definition) that Aurelia can recognize.
- Add `@customElement(...)` if you are not relying on conventions.

## Troubleshooting

- Inspect what the import resolves to (the `%s` value) and confirm it’s the expected component.
- Ensure you’re importing the correct module/export.
