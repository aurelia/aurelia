# AUR3271: Transition Failed

## Message

`AUR3271: Transition %s failed with error: %s`

## Description

This error is logged when a router transition fails due to an exception during navigation.

## Common Scenarios

- An exception thrown from a lifecycle hook (`canLoad`, `loading`, `canUnload`, etc.).
- An exception thrown while resolving a component/view-model.
- A custom navigation strategy throws.

## Troubleshooting

- Inspect the second `%s` value (the original error) for the root cause and stack trace.
- If the failure comes from a hook, add logging inside the hook to confirm inputs and return values.
