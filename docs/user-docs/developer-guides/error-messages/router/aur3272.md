# AUR3272: Root RouteContext Not Set

## Error Message

`AUR3272: Root RouteContext is not set. Did you forget to register RouteConfiguration, or try to navigate before calling Aurelia.start()?`

## Description

This error occurs when router navigation is attempted but the root `RouteContext` has not been established. The most common causes are:

- Router configuration was not registered.
- Navigation is attempted before `Aurelia.start()` completes.

## Solutions

- Ensure `RouterConfiguration` is registered (for example via `Aurelia.register(...)`).
- Only navigate after `await aurelia.start()`.

## Troubleshooting

- Verify your `main.ts` (or equivalent) registers router configuration exactly once.
- Check whether navigation is triggered during construction/binding before the app is started.
