# AUR3350: Unexpected Viewport Activation

## Error Message

`AUR3350: Unexpected viewport activation outside of a transition context at %s`

## Description

This error indicates the router attempted to activate a viewport outside of an active transition context. In normal application code this should not happen and usually indicates an internal state problem.

## Troubleshooting

- If you can reproduce this reliably, please report it with a minimal reproduction.
- Check for custom integrations that call viewport agent APIs directly.
