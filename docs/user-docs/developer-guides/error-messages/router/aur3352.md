# AUR3352: Unexpected Viewport Agent State

## Error Message

`AUR3352: Unexpected state at %s of %s`

## Description

This error indicates the viewport agent reached an unexpected internal state. In most cases, this should be treated as a router bug unless you are calling low-level viewport agent APIs directly.

## Troubleshooting

- Capture the two `%s` values and include them in a bug report.
- If you have custom viewport agent usage, ensure calls are made through supported router APIs.
