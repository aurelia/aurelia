# AUR3401: No Matching Route and No Fallback

## Error Message

`AUR3401: Neither the route '%s' matched any configured route at '%s' nor a fallback is configured for the viewport '%s' - did you forget to add '%s' to the routes list of the route decorator of '%s'?`

## Description

This error occurs when the router cannot recognize the requested route and there is no fallback configured for the target viewport.

## Common Scenarios

- Navigating to a path that is not configured in the route table.
- Forgetting to register a routed component (or its routes) in the correct routing context.

## Solutions

- Add the missing route to your route configuration.
- Ensure the component that owns the routes is registered/active for the current navigation.
- Configure a fallback route for the viewport if desired.

## Troubleshooting

- Check the path you are navigating to and compare it with configured routes.
- Verify the component mentioned in the last `%s` has the route configured.
