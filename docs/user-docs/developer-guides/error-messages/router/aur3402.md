# AUR3402: Unknown Redirect Route

## Error Message

`AUR3402: '%s' did not match any configured route or registered component name at '%s' - did you forget to add '%s' to the routes list of the route decorator of '%s'?`

## Description

This error occurs when the router processes a redirect route but the redirect target cannot be recognized as a configured route or registered component name in the current routing context.

## Solutions

- Ensure the redirect target points to a valid configured route.
- Ensure the redirected-to component is registered/available in the same routing context.

## Troubleshooting

- Check the redirect configuration and verify the target is correct.
- Confirm the route table includes the redirect destination.
