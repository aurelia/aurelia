# AUR3551: RouteContext Required for Component Name

## Error Message

`AUR3551: When retrieving the RouteConfig for a component name, a RouteContext (that can resolve it) must be provided`

## Description

This error occurs when the router is asked to resolve route configuration from a component name string but no `RouteContext` is available to resolve that name.

## Solutions

- Provide a `RouteContext` when resolving route configuration by string name.
- Prefer passing component types/definitions instead of string names where possible.
