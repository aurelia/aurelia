# AUR3552: Component Not Found / Not Registered

## Error Message

`AUR3552: Could not find a CustomElement named '%s' in the current container scope of %s. This means the component is neither registered at Aurelia startup nor via the 'dependencies' decorator or static property.`

## Description

This error occurs when a component name is resolved during routing but the component is not registered in the current DI/container scope.

## Solutions

- Register the component globally (during app startup), or locally via `dependencies`.
- Ensure the component name matches the custom element name.

## Troubleshooting

- Check spelling/casing of the component name.
- Verify the component is available in the current routing context’s container.
