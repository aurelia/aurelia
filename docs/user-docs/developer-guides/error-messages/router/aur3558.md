# AUR3558: Navigation Strategy Component Not Resolved

## Error Message

`AUR3558: Invalid operation, the component is not yet resolved for the navigation strategy (id: %s).`

## Description

This error occurs when the router attempts an operation that requires a navigation strategy component to be resolved, but it has not been resolved yet.

## Troubleshooting

- If you are using custom navigation strategies, ensure they resolve components before performing operations that require them.
- If you encounter this without custom strategies, please report it with a reproduction.
