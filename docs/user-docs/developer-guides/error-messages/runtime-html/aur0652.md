# AUR0652: Node Observer Strategy Not Found

## Error Message

`AUR0652: Aurelia is unable to observe property <property>. Register observation mapping with .useConfig().`

Where `<property>` is the name of the DOM element property that Aurelia tried to observe.

## Description

This error occurs when Aurelia's binding system attempts to create an observer for a specific property on an HTML element node, but it cannot find a suitable observation strategy for that combination of element type and property name. Aurelia comes with built-in observers for common properties (like `value` on `<input>`, `checked` on checkboxes, `scrollTop` on elements, etc.), but this error indicates the requested property is not covered by the default strategies.

## Cause

1.  **Binding to Non-Standard/Custom Properties:** You are trying to bind to a property on a standard HTML element that Aurelia doesn't observe by default (e.g., binding directly to a less common DOM property or a custom property added to an element).
2.  **Typo:** The property name in the binding expression might be misspelled (e.g., `valuee.bind` instead of `value.bind`).
3.  **Missing Configuration for Custom Elements/Attributes:** If you are working with custom elements or attributes that need specific observation logic (perhaps interacting with third-party libraries or complex components), the necessary observation strategy might not have been registered with Aurelia's `NodeObserverLocator`.

## Solution

1.  **Verify Property Name:** Double-check the spelling of the property name in your binding expression in the HTML template. Ensure it matches the actual DOM property you intend to observe.
2.  **Use Standard Bindable Properties:** For custom elements, prefer defining `@bindable` properties in your view model and bind to those, rather than trying to directly observe arbitrary DOM properties of the custom element's host.
3.  **Register Custom Observation Strategy:** If you genuinely need to observe a specific, non-standard DOM property, you may need to implement and register a custom `IObserverLocator` or `INodeObserverLocator` strategy. This is an advanced scenario, typically required when integrating with libraries that manipulate the DOM in non-standard ways or for observing properties not natively supported. You would register this during your application's startup configuration phase using `.withConfig()`.

## Example

```html
<!-- Incorrect: Assuming 'customProp' is not a standard bindable property -->
<!-- nor has a registered observer -->
<my-element custom-prop.bind="value"></my-element>

<!-- Incorrect: Typo in standard property -->
<input valuee.bind="name"> <!-- Should be 'value' -->

<!-- Correct: Binding to a standard, observable property -->
<input value.bind="name">

<!-- Correct: Binding to a properly defined bindable property -->
<!-- on a custom element -->
<my-element normal-bindable.bind="value"></my-element>
```

```typescript
// View Model for my-element
import { bindable, customElement } from 'aurelia';

@customElement('my-element')
export class MyElement {
  // This is the correct way to make a property bindable
  @bindable normalBindable: string;

  // This property exists, but without @bindable or a custom observer,
  // trying to bind to 'customProp' from the outside might cause AUR0652
  // if Aurelia doesn't know how to observe it directly on the host element.
  customProp: string;
}
```

## Debugging Tips

*   Carefully inspect the property name `<property>` mentioned in the error message.
*   Check the HTML element type associated with the binding.
*   If it's a standard HTML element, verify if the property is commonly observed by Aurelia (like `value`, `checked`, `scrollTop`, `scrollLeft`, `css`, style properties). If not, direct observation might not be supported.
*   If it's a custom element, ensure you are binding to a property explicitly marked with `@bindable` in the element's view model.
*   Consider if the property is part of a third-party library integration; you might need specific configuration or adapters provided by that library or custom observation logic.
