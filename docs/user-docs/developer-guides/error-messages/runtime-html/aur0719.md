# AUR0719: Duplicate Attribute Mapping Rule

## Error Message

`AUR0719: Attribute <attribute> has been already registered for <element>`

Where `<attribute>` is the HTML attribute name (e.g., `for`) and `<element>` is the element tag name (e.g., `label` or `*` for all elements).

## Description

This error indicates an internal inconsistency detected by Aurelia's `AttributeMapper`. The `AttributeMapper` is responsible for understanding how HTML attributes should map to component properties (e.g., mapping the `readonly` attribute to a `readOnly` property). This error occurs when the mapper detects that a rule attempting to define such a mapping for a specific HTML attribute and element combination has already been registered.

## Cause

This error is generally **not** caused by standard application configuration like defining `@bindable` properties or using default Aurelia setups. Standard mechanisms handle attribute mapping implicitly. The most likely causes are:

1.  **Internal Framework Issue:** A potential bug within Aurelia's `AttributeMapper` or related compilation/configuration services could lead to duplicate registration attempts for the same mapping rule.
2.  **Unsupported Internal API Usage:** Advanced or non-standard code directly interacting with and attempting to modify the internal `AttributeMapper` instance during runtime or configuration might inadvertently cause duplicate registrations. Standard application development should not involve direct manipulation of the `AttributeMapper`.
3.  **Plugin Conflict (Rare):** In very rare cases, two different plugins attempting low-level manipulation of the `AttributeMapper` could potentially conflict, although well-behaved plugins should avoid this.

## Solution

Since this usually points to an internal issue or unsupported usage:

1.  **Update Aurelia Packages:** Ensure you are using the latest compatible versions of all Aurelia packages. The issue might be a known bug that has been fixed.
2.  **Remove Internal API Usage:** If you have any code directly accessing or modifying the `AttributeMapper` service, remove it. Rely on standard Aurelia mechanisms like `@bindable` for property mapping.
3.  **Check Plugins:** If using plugins, especially those performing low-level framework modifications, try temporarily disabling them to see if the error disappears. If a plugin is identified as the cause, report the issue to the plugin author.
4.  **Isolate and Reproduce:** Try to identify the specific component or scenario that triggers the error. Create the smallest possible reproduction case.
5.  **Report the Issue:** If you suspect a framework bug after ruling out unsupported API usage and plugin conflicts, report the issue on the Aurelia GitHub repository, providing the minimal reproduction and details about your Aurelia versions.

## Debugging Tips

*   Identify the `<attribute>` and `<element>` names from the error message. This tells you which mapping rule is being duplicated.
*   Examine the stack trace when the error occurs. This might provide clues about which part of the framework or which plugin is attempting the duplicate registration.
*   Review recent changes to your codebase, especially around application startup configuration, plugins, or any potentially non-standard framework interactions.
*   Search the Aurelia GitHub issues to see if this specific mapping conflict has been reported or resolved previously.
