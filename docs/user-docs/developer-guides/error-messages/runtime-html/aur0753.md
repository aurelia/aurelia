# AUR0753: Custom Attribute Resource Not Found

## Error Message

`AUR0753: Attribute <attribute-name> is not registered in <component-name>.`

Where `<attribute-name>` is the name of the custom attribute used in the template, and `<component-name>` is the name of the component whose template is being rendered.

## Description

This error occurs during rendering when Aurelia encounters a custom attribute in the template (e.g., `<div my-attribute.bind="..."></div>`), but it cannot find the definition for that attribute (`my-attribute`) within the resources registered for the current component or globally. This applies to regular custom attributes, not template controllers (which have a separate error code, AUR0754).

## Cause

The causes are analogous to those for missing custom elements (AUR0752):

1.  **Missing Import:** The custom attribute class was not imported into the component's view model file.
2.  **Missing `dependencies` Array:** The custom attribute was imported but not included in the `dependencies` array of the component's definition.
3.  **Typo in Attribute Name:** The name used in the template (e.g., `my-attrbute`) doesn't match the registered name of the custom attribute (e.g., `my-attribute`). Attribute names are case-insensitive in HTML but often defined with kebab-case.
4.  **Incorrect Registration:** The attribute is defined elsewhere but wasn't correctly registered globally (`Aurelia.register(...)`) or locally via `dependencies`.
5.  **Build/Bundling Issues:** The build process failed to include the attribute definition.

## Solution

The solutions mirror those for custom elements:

1.  **Import the Attribute:** Ensure the custom attribute class is imported in the view model file.
2.  **Add to Dependencies:** Add the imported custom attribute class to the `dependencies` array.

    ```typescript
    import { MyAttribute } from './my-attribute';
    import { customElement } from 'aurelia';

    @customElement({
      name: 'my-component',
      template: `<div my-attribute></div>`,
      dependencies: [MyAttribute] // <-- Add here
    })
    export class MyComponent { }
    ```

3.  **Verify Name:** Check the attribute name in the template against its definition (`@customAttribute('my-attribute')` or similar).
4.  **Check Registration:** Ensure proper global or local registration.
5.  **Verify Build:** Check the build/bundler configuration and output.

## Debugging Tips

*   Check the browser's console for the exact error message.
*   Verify the import path and the `dependencies` array.
*   Search the codebase for the attribute definition to confirm the name.
*   Inspect the browser's loaded sources to see if the attribute's code is present.
