# AUR0755: View Factory Provider Not Ready

## Error Message

`AUR0755: Cannot resolve ViewFactory before the provider was prepared.`

## Description

This is typically an internal error indicating a timing issue within Aurelia's rendering pipeline. It occurs when the system attempts to retrieve the `ViewFactory` for a component (which is needed to create instances of the component's view) before the component's definition and associated resources (especially its template) have been fully compiled and made available through its internal provider.

## Cause

This error is unlikely to be caused directly by typical application code. Potential indirect causes or related scenarios could involve:

1.  **Deeply Nested or Complex Asynchronous Rendering:** Highly complex component trees involving multiple asynchronous operations (like dynamic composition or intricate data loading affecting structure) might, in rare edge cases, lead to timing issues where a dependency requests a ViewFactory prematurely.
2.  **Manual Manipulation of Internal APIs:** Directly interacting with or manipulating internal Aurelia rendering APIs or the DI container in unsupported ways could potentially trigger this state.
3.  **Issues in Custom Rendering Logic:** If you have implemented highly custom rendering logic, custom elements, or attributes that interact with the rendering engine or DI container at a low level, there might be a flaw in that logic causing this timing problem.
4.  **Potential Bug in Aurelia:** In rare cases, this could indicate an underlying bug within Aurelia's rendering engine or resource handling logic.

## Solution

As this is often an internal timing issue, direct solutions in application code are less common. Focus on ensuring standard practices are followed:

1.  **Simplify Complex Structures:** If the error occurs in a particularly complex part of your UI involving nested dynamic composition or heavy async operations, try simplifying the structure or adjusting the timing of data loading relative to rendering.
2.  **Avoid Internal API Manipulation:** Do not directly call internal, undocumented Aurelia APIs related to rendering, resource providers, or ViewFactories unless you have a deep understanding of the framework internals. Stick to the public APIs and standard component lifecycle hooks.
3.  **Review Custom Rendering Code:** If you have custom elements, attributes, or other extensions that deeply integrate with the rendering process, carefully review their logic for potential timing issues or incorrect interaction with the DI system or component lifecycle.
4.  **Update Aurelia Packages:** Ensure you are using the latest compatible versions of Aurelia packages, as internal bugs are often fixed in updates.
5.  **Isolate the Issue:** Try to isolate the component or scenario that triggers the error. Create a minimal reproduction case. This can help identify if it's related to a specific component's setup or a more general problem.
6.  **Report the Issue:** If you suspect an Aurelia bug after ruling out issues in your code, please create a minimal reproduction and report the issue to the Aurelia GitHub repository, providing details about the scenario, Aurelia versions, and the reproduction steps.

## Debugging Tips

*   Use the browser's debugger and examine the call stack when the error occurs. This might give clues about which part of the rendering process is attempting to resolve the `ViewFactory` prematurely.
*   Trace the lifecycle hooks (`created`, `binding`, `bound`, `attaching`) of the involved components to understand the sequence of events leading up to the error.
*   Temporarily comment out sections of the template or features within the problematic component to pinpoint the trigger.
