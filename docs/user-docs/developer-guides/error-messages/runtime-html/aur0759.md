# AUR0759: Custom Attribute Definition Not Found

## Error Message

`AUR0759: No attribute definition found for type <TypeName>`

Where `<TypeName>` is the name of the class that was expected to be a custom attribute.

## Description

This error occurs when Aurelia attempts to retrieve the definition metadata for a custom attribute class but fails to find it. Custom attribute definitions contain essential information like the attribute's name, bindables, and other configurations, typically provided via the `@customAttribute` decorator or inferred through conventions.

## Cause

The most common causes are:

1.  **Missing Decorator/Convention:** The class intended to be a custom attribute is missing the `@customAttribute` decorator, and it doesn't follow a naming convention that allows Aurelia to automatically recognize it as such (if conventions are enabled).
2.  **Incorrect Registration:** The custom attribute class might be defined but not correctly registered as a dependency within the component or application scope where it's being used.
3.  **Build/Bundling Issues:** Problems during the build process might prevent the decorator metadata from being correctly emitted or associated with the class.
4.  **Circular Dependencies:** Complex circular dependencies involving the custom attribute class might interfere with metadata retrieval.

## Solution

1.  **Apply Decorator:** Ensure the class has the `@customAttribute('attribute-name')` decorator applied, specifying the HTML attribute name.
    ```typescript
    import { customAttribute } from 'aurelia';

    @customAttribute('my-highlight')
    export class MyHighlightAttribute {
      // ... attribute logic ...
    }
    ```
2.  **Use Naming Convention:** If relying on conventions, ensure the class name follows the expected pattern (e.g., `MyHighlightCustomAttribute` might conventionally map to `my-highlight`). Verify that conventions are enabled and configured correctly in your Aurelia setup.
3.  **Register Dependency:** Make sure the custom attribute is registered appropriately, either globally in `main.ts` or locally in the `dependencies` array of the component/element using it.
    ```typescript
    // In main.ts for global registration
    import { MyHighlightAttribute } from './my-highlight-attribute';
    Aurelia.register(MyHighlightAttribute /* ... other registrations */)
           // ...

    // Or in a component for local registration
    import { MyHighlightAttribute } from './my-highlight-attribute';
    import { customElement } from 'aurelia';

    @customElement({
      name: 'my-component',
      template: `<div my-highlight>...</div>`,
      dependencies: [MyHighlightAttribute]
    })
    export class MyComponent { }
    ```
4.  **Check Build Configuration:** Verify your build process (e.g., Webpack, Vite configuration) correctly handles decorators and TypeScript/JavaScript compilation. Ensure `emitDecoratorMetadata` and `experimentalDecorators` (or equivalent flags) are enabled in your `tsconfig.json`.
5.  **Resolve Circular Dependencies:** Analyze and refactor any circular dependencies involving the attribute class.

## Debugging Tips

*   Verify the `@customAttribute` decorator is present and correctly spelled on the class definition.
*   Check the name provided to the decorator (or inferred by convention) matches the usage in the HTML template.
*   Confirm the attribute class is imported and included in the `dependencies` array of the consuming component or registered globally.
*   Inspect the compiled JavaScript output to see if the decorator metadata seems present.
*   Temporarily replace the custom attribute usage with standard HTML/bindings to rule out other template issues.
