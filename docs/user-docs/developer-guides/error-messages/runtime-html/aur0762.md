# AUR0762: Node is Not a Custom Element Host

## Error Message

`AUR0762: Trying to retrieve a custom element controller from a node, but the provided node <{{nodeName}} /> is not a custom element or containerless host.`

Where `{{nodeName}}` is the tag name (or `#comment` for comment nodes) of the provided DOM node.

## Description

This error occurs when calling `CustomElement.for(node)` (or an API that uses it) with a DOM node that is not the host element (or containerless marker) of an Aurelia custom element instance.

## Example Trigger

```ts
import { CustomElement } from '@aurelia/runtime-html';

// ❌ Passing a normal element instead of a custom element host
const div = document.querySelector('div')!;
CustomElement.for(div); // throws AUR0762
```

## Correct Usage

- Pass the actual host element of the custom element instance (for example the `<my-component>` element).
- For containerless custom elements, the host is a comment marker node; prefer alternative access patterns (DI, parent/child relationships) rather than trying to locate the marker manually.

## Troubleshooting

- Verify you are not passing a node inside a component’s template (use the component host instead).
- Ensure the node is part of the Aurelia-managed DOM tree for the app instance you are querying.
- If you are calling this too early, wait until `attached()` (or after composition completes).
