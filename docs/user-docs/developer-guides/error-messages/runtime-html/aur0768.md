# AUR0768: Aurelia Instance Already Exists in Container

## Error Message

`AUR0768: An instance of Aurelia is already registered with the container or an ancestor of it.`

## Description

This error occurs when you attempt to create a new `Aurelia` instance (e.g., `new Aurelia(container)`) but the provided dependency injection (DI) container, or one of its parent containers, already has an instance of `Aurelia` registered with it. Each Aurelia application should typically have its own distinct DI container hierarchy, and this error prevents accidentally creating nested or conflicting application instances within the same hierarchy.

## Cause

1.  **Creating Multiple Aurelia Instances with the Same Container:** Explicitly creating `new Aurelia(container)` more than once, passing the exact same container instance each time.
2.  **Creating Aurelia Instance with a Child Container:** Creating a child container (`const childContainer = container.createChild()`) from a container that already belongs to an `Aurelia` instance, and then attempting to create a new `Aurelia` instance with that child container (`new Aurelia(childContainer)`). The constructor checks ancestor containers as well.
3.  **Accidental Re-initialization:** Code logic that inadvertently tries to initialize and start an Aurelia application multiple times without properly disposing of the previous instance and container.

## Solution

1.  **Use a Single Aurelia Instance:** Ensure that your application logic creates and manages only one `Aurelia` instance for a given DI container hierarchy. Store the instance if it needs to be referenced later, rather than creating a new one.
2.  **Use Separate Containers for Separate Apps:** If you genuinely need multiple, independent Aurelia applications running concurrently (e.g., micro-frontends), ensure each one is created with a completely separate root DI container (`new Container()`). Do not share containers or use child containers across these independent applications.
3.  **Proper Disposal:** If you need to stop and restart an Aurelia application (uncommon), ensure you call `aurelia.dispose()` on the old instance before creating a new one with a fresh container.

## Example

```typescript
import Aurelia from 'aurelia';
import { DI, IContainer } from '@aurelia/kernel';

// Scenario 1: Reusing the same container
const container = DI.createContainer();
const aurelia1 = new Aurelia(container); // OK

// Incorrect: Trying to create another Aurelia instance with the same container
try {
  const aurelia2 = new Aurelia(container); // Throws AUR0768
} catch (e) {
  console.error(e.message); // Logs the AUR0768 error
}

// Scenario 2: Using a child container
const rootContainer = DI.createContainer();
const app1 = new Aurelia(rootContainer); // OK

const childContainer = rootContainer.createChild();
// Incorrect: Trying to create a new Aurelia instance with a child container
try {
  const app2 = new Aurelia(childContainer); // Throws AUR0768
} catch (e) {
  console.error(e.message); // Logs the AUR0768 error
}

// Correct approach for multiple independent apps:
const containerA = DI.createContainer();
const aureliaA = new Aurelia(containerA);
// ... configure and start aureliaA

const containerB = DI.createContainer();
const aureliaB = new Aurelia(containerB);
// ... configure and start aureliaB (independent)

```

## Debugging Tips

*   Examine the code where `new Aurelia(...)` is called.
*   Identify the container instance being passed to the constructor.
*   Check if that specific container instance (or any of its ancestors) has been used previously to create another `Aurelia` instance.
*   Use logging or debugging to track the lifecycle of your DI containers and `Aurelia` instances, especially if you suspect accidental re-initialization.
*   If using child containers, visualize the container hierarchy to understand potential conflicts.
