# AUR9993: 'updateTrigger' Binding Behavior Not Supported by Observer

## Error Message

`AUR9993: "& updateTrigger" binding behavior only works with the default implementation of Aurelia HTML observation. Implement your own node observation + updateTrigger`

## Description

This error occurs when the `updateTrigger` binding behavior (`& updateTrigger:'event1'...'eventN'`) is used on a binding where the underlying observation mechanism does not support the standard event handling required by `updateTrigger`. The `updateTrigger` behavior relies on specific capabilities provided by Aurelia's default observation strategies for HTML elements to listen for DOM events and trigger updates.

## Cause

The primary cause is using `& updateTrigger` in conjunction with a custom observation strategy or a binding scenario where Aurelia's default HTML observer is not employed or cannot provide the necessary event handling integration. This is relatively uncommon in standard application development but might occur if:

1.  **Custom Observation:** You have implemented or are using a custom element or attribute with a bespoke observation mechanism that doesn't align with the internal requirements of the `updateTrigger` behavior.
2.  **Unsupported Element/Property Combination:** In rare cases, the specific combination of element and property being bound might use an internal observation strategy that isn't compatible with `updateTrigger`. (This is less likely for standard HTML elements and properties).

The `updateTrigger` behavior needs to interact with an observer that can handle event listener management (specifically, an observer marked internally as `$needsHandler: true`). If the observer lacks this capability, the error is thrown.

## Solution

1.  **Use Default Observation:** If possible, refactor the binding or component to use Aurelia's standard HTML observation mechanisms, which are compatible with `updateTrigger`. This usually means binding directly to standard HTML element properties like `value`, `checked`, etc.
2.  **Implement Custom Update Logic:** If standard observation is not feasible or desirable, you must implement the update-on-event logic manually. Instead of using `& updateTrigger`, create event listeners (`.trigger` or `.capture`) that call methods on your view model. These methods can then read the target property's value and update the source property accordingly.
3.  **Re-evaluate Need for `updateTrigger`:** Consider if `updateTrigger` is strictly necessary. For many standard two-way bindings (`.two-way` or default for inputs), Aurelia already updates the view model based on the appropriate default events (`input`, `change`, etc.). `updateTrigger` is mainly for changing *which* events trigger the update.

## Example

```html
<!-- Standard usage (Correct, assumes default observation) -->
<input value.bind="firstName & updateTrigger:'blur':'paste'">

<!-- Scenario causing the error (Conceptual) -->
<!-- Assume 'my-custom-input' uses an incompatible custom observer -->
<my-custom-input data.bind="complexData & updateTrigger:'custom-update-event'">
</my-custom-input>

<!-- Solution 2: Manual update logic -->
<my-custom-input data.from-view="complexData" custom-update-event.trigger="handleCustomUpdate($event.target.data)">
</my-custom-input>
```

```typescript
// View Model for Manual Update Logic (Solution 2)
import { customElement } from 'aurelia';

@customElement({ /* ... */ })
export class MyComponent {
  complexData: unknown;

  handleCustomUpdate(newData: unknown) {
    // Manually update the view model property when the event fires
    this.complexData = newData;
    console.log('Updated complexData on custom-update-event:', this.complexData);
  }
}
```

## Debugging Tips

*   Identify the binding where `& updateTrigger` is causing the error.
*   Examine the type of element and property being bound. Is it a standard HTML element/property or a custom one?
*   If it's a custom element/attribute, review its implementation, particularly how its properties are observed.
*   Temporarily remove the `& updateTrigger` behavior. Does the binding work otherwise?
*   Consider implementing the logic manually using event listeners (`.trigger`, `.capture`) as shown in Solution 2 to bypass the `updateTrigger` mechanism if compatibility is the issue.
