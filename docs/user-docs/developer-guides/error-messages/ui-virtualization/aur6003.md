# AUR6003: Scroller info is readonly

## Error Message

`AUR6003: Scroller info is readonly and cannot be modified.`

## Description

This error occurs when code attempts to mutate scroller information that the virtualization system treats as readonly (internal state used for measurement and scheduling).

## Example Trigger

This is most commonly triggered by directly modifying internal virtualization/scroller state from custom code or a custom integration.

## Correct Usage

- Treat virtualization internals as readonly.
- Use public APIs/configuration options (or supported extension points) instead of mutating internal scroller info objects.

## Troubleshooting

- Search for code that assigns to scroller/virtual-repeat internal properties (for example in custom strategies or wrappers).
- If you need custom behavior, prefer implementing a supported strategy/adapter rather than mutating internal state.
