# AUR6004: Invalid render target

## Error Message

`AUR6004: Invalid render target. The target element must have a parent node.`

## Description

This error occurs when the virtual repeater attempts to insert/move views, but the render target is detached (its `parentNode` is `null`). Virtualization requires the target to be in the DOM.

## Example Trigger

```html
<!-- ❌ The virtual-repeat host is conditionally removed while still active -->
<div if.bind="show">
  <div virtual-repeat.for="item of items">${item}</div>
</div>
```

If `show` flips rapidly during activation, the repeater may try to render into a detached node.

## Correct Usage

- Avoid tearing down the virtual-repeat host while it is initializing.
- Prefer guarding the entire component (or delaying data/activation) so the repeater initializes on a stable DOM tree.

## Troubleshooting

- Check lifecycle timing: ensure the host stays attached during bind/attach.
- If you toggle `if.bind`, consider debouncing the toggle or moving virtualization to a stable container.
