# Navigating

This section details how you can use the load method on the router instance or load attribute to navigate to other parts of your application.&#x20;

### Router instance

To use the `load` method, you have to first inject the router into your component. This can be done easily by using the `IRouter` decorator on your component constructor method. The following code will add a property to your component called `router` which we can reference.

```typescript
import { IRouter, IRouteableComponent } from '@aurelia/router';

export class MyComponent implements IRouteableComponent {
    constructor(@IRouter private router: IRouter) {

    }
}
```

### Navigating without options

The `load` method can accept a simple string value allowing you to navigate to another component without needing to supply any configuration options.

```typescript
import { IRouter, IRouteableComponent } from '@aurelia/router';

export class MyComponent implements IRouteableComponent {
    constructor(@IRouter private router: IRouter) {

    }

    async viewProducts() {
        await this.router.load('/products');
    }
}
```

You could also use the string value method to pass parameter values and do something like this where our route expects a product ID and we pass 12:

```typescript
import { IRouter, IRouteableComponent } from '@aurelia/router';

export class MyComponent implements IRouteableComponent {
    constructor(@IRouter private router: IRouter) {

    }

    async viewProducts() {
        await this.router.load(`/products/12`);
    }
}
```

### Specifying load options

The router instance `load` method allows you to specify different properties on a per-use basis. The most common one being the `title` property to allow you to modify the title as you navigate to your route.

A list of available load options can be found below:

* `title` — Sets the title of the component being loaded
* `queryParams` — Specify an object to be serialized to a query string, and then set to the query string of the new URL.
* `fragment` — Specify the hash fragment for the new URL.

These option values can be specified as follows and when needed:

```typescript
import { IRouter, IRouteableComponent } from '@aurelia/router';

export class MyComponent implements IRouteableComponent {
    constructor(@IRouter private router: IRouter) {

    }

    async viewProduct() {
        await this.router.load('products', {
            title: 'My product',
            queryParams: {
                prop1: 'val',
                tracking: 'asdasdjaks232'
            },
            fragment: 'jfjdjf'
        });
    }
}
```

### HTML load attribute

The router also allows you to decorate links and buttons in your application using a `load` attribute which works the same way as the router instance `load` method.

If you have routes defined on a root level (inside of `my-app.ts`) you will need to add a forward slash in front of any routes you attempt to load. The following would work in the case of an application using configured routes.

```markup
<a load="/products/12">Product #12</a>
```

The load attribute can do more than just accept a string value. You can also bind to the load attribute as well for more explicit routing. The following example is a bit redundant as specifying `route:product` would be the same as specifying `load="product"` but if you're wanting more explicit routing, it conveys the intent better.

```html
<a load="route:product;">My Route</a>
```

And where things really start to get interesting is when you want to pass parameters to a route. We use the `params` configuration property to specify parameters.

```html
<a load="route:profile; params.bind:{name: 'rob'}">View Profile</a>
```

In the above example, we provide the route (`id`) value (via `route: profile`). But, then also provide an object of parameters (via `params.bind: { name: 'rob' }`). These parameter values correspond to any parameters configured in your route definition. In our case, our route looks like this:

```typescript
{
    id: 'profile',
    path: 'profile/:name',
    component: () => import('./view-profile'),
    title: 'View Profile'
},
```

## Handling unknown routes

Sometimes a user might attempt to visit a route that doesn't exist (either user error or because it was removed). You will want to configure your applications to display a fallback route in those situations.

To add in fallback behavior, we can do this two ways. The `fallback` attribute on the `<au-viewport>` element or in the router `customize` method (code).

### Create the fallback component

Let's create the `missing-page` component (this is required or the fallback behavior will not work). First, we'll create the view-model for our `missing-page` component.

{% code title="missing-page.ts" %}
```typescript
export class MissingPage {
  public static parameters = ['id'];
  public missingComponent: string ;

  public load(parameters: {id: string}): void {
    this.missingComponent = parameters.id;
  }
}
```
{% endcode %}

For the `fallback` component, an ID gets passed as a parameter which is the value from the URL. If you were to attempt to visit a non-existent route called "ROB" the `missingComponent` value would be ROB.

Now, the HTML.

{% code title="missing-page.html" %}
```html
<h3>Ouch! I couldn't find '${missingComponent}'!</h3>
```
{% endcode %}

### Programmatically

By using the `fallback` property on the `customize` method when we register the router, we can pass a component.

```typescript
import Aurelia from 'aurelia';
import { RouterConfiguration } from '@aurelia/router';
import { MyApp } from './my-app';
import { MissingPage } from './missing-page'; 

Aurelia
  .register(RouterConfiguration.customize({
    fallback: MissingPage,
  }))
  .app(MyApp)
  .start();
```

### Attribute

Sometimes the `fallback` attribute can be the prefered approach to registering a fallback. Import your fallback component and pass the name to the `fallback` attribute. Same result, but it doesn't require touching the router registration.

{% code title="my-app.html" %}
```html
<import from="./missing-page"></import>

<au-viewport fallback="missing-page"></au-viewport>
```
{% endcode %}
