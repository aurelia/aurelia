# Dockerizing Aurelia Applications

Docker is a powerful tool that allows developers to package applications into containersâ€”standardized executable components combining application source code with the operating system (OS) libraries and dependencies required to run that code in any environment. Dockerizing an Aurelia 2 application can simplify deployment and ensure consistency across different environments. Here's a guide on how to Dockerize an Aurelia 2 application using TypeScript and leveraging Dependency Injection (DI) concepts.

## Prerequisites

- Ensure you have Docker installed on your machine. You can download it from [Docker's official website](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).
- An Aurelia 2 application created and ready to be containerized.

## Create a Dockerfile

The `Dockerfile` is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image. Create a `Dockerfile` in the root of your Aurelia 2 project with the following content:

```Dockerfile
# Step 1: Use the official Node.js 20 image as the base image
FROM node:20 AS build

# Step 2: Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Step 3: Copy package.json and package-lock.json (or yarn.lock)
COPY package*.json ./

# Step 4: Install project dependencies
RUN npm install

# Step 5: Copy the rest of the project files into the container
COPY . .

# Step 6: Build the Aurelia 2 project
RUN npm run build

# Step 7: Use Nginx to serve the application
FROM nginx:alpine

# Step 8: Copy the build artifacts from the previous stage
COPY --from=build /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html

# Step 9: Expose port 80 to the outside once the container has launched
EXPOSE 80

# Step 10: Start Nginx and serve the application
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

This multi-stage build first creates a build of the Aurelia application and then sets up a lightweight Nginx server to serve the static files.

## Build the Docker Image

Run the following command to build the Docker image. Replace `your-app-name` with the name you wish to give your Docker image.

```bash
docker build -t your-app-name .
```

## Run the Docker Container

Once the image is built, you can run your Aurelia 2 application in a Docker container using:

```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:80 your-app-name
```

This command will start a Docker container with your Aurelia 2 application running on port 8080.

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you have successfully Dockerized your Aurelia 2 application, making it ready for easy deployment to any environment that supports Docker. Additionally, you've seen how to use Aurelia's DI system to manage services in a modern, type-safe manner using TypeScript.
