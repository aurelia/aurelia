# Essentials

Aurelia is a modern JavaScript framework that empowers you to build exceptional web applications with clean, maintainable code. If you're familiar with HTML, CSS, and modern JavaScript/TypeScript, this essentials guide will introduce you to Aurelia's core concepts and get you productive quickly.

This section provides a practical overview of Aurelia's fundamental building blocks. Each concept links to comprehensive documentation where you can dive deeper, but these essentials give you everything needed to start building with confidence.

## What Makes Aurelia Different
