# Conditional Rendering

Have you ever needed to hide or show part of a UI based on some condition? Well, that's what conditional rendering is all about! Let's dig in and see how it works.

{% hint style="success" %}
**Here's what you'll learn...**

* Adding and removing DOM with `if`/`else`, and `switch`.
* Hiding and showing DOM with `show`/`hide`.
* Choosing between `if`/`else` and `show`/`hide`.
* Facilitate partial and deferred rendering with `promise`.
{% endhint %}

## if/else

Aurelia has two major tools for conditional display: `if` and `show`. Let's look at `if` first. Here's a basic "Hello World" that asks the user if they want to greet the world:

{% code title="my-app.html" %}
```markup
<label for="greet">Would you like me to greet the world?</label>
<input type="checkbox" id="greet" checked.bind="greet">
<div if.bind="greet">
  Hello, World!
</div>
```
{% endcode %}

If the value of `greet` is `true`, then the `div` with the message "Hello, World!" will be inserted into the DOM. If it's `false`, the `div` will be removed \(or never added in the first place\).

Conditionals can also be `one-time` bound, so that parts of the template are fixed once they're instantiated:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="my-app.html" %}
```markup
<div if.one-time="greet">
  Hello, World!
</div>
<div if.one-time="!greet">
  Some other time.
</div>
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="my-app.js" %}
```javascript
export class MyApp {
  greet = (Math.random() > 0.5);
}
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

There's a 50-50 chance that we'll greet the world, or put it off until later. Once the page loads, this is fixed, because the data is `one-time` bound.

Complementing `if`, there is `else`. Used in conjunction with `if`, `else` will render its content when `if` does not evaluate to `true`.

{% code title="my-app.html" %}
```markup
<div if.bind="showMessage">
  <span>${message}</span>
</div>
<div else>
  <span>Nothing to see here</span>
</div>
```
{% endcode %}

Elements using the `else` template modifier must follow an `if` bound element to make contextual sense and function properly.

### Caching View Instances

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Not Yet Implemented in Aurelia 2**
{% endhint %}

By default, `if` caches the underlying view instance. Although the element is being removed from the DOM and the component goes through the `detached` and `unbind` lifecyle events, its instance is kept in memory for further condition changes. Therefore, when the element is hidden and then shown again, `if` does not need to initialize the component again.

You can opt-out this default behavior by setting the `cache` binding of the `if` attribute explicitly. This is especially useful when using `if` on custom elements where initializing them on every appearance is crucial.

{% code title="my-app.html" %}
```markup
<div if="condition.bind: showMessage; cache: false">
  <span>${message}</span>
</div>
```
{% endcode %}

## show/hide

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Note Yet Implemented in Aurelia 2**
{% endhint %}

The difference between `if` and `show` is that `if` removes the element entirely from the DOM, and `show` toggles the `aurelia-hide` CSS class which controls the element's visibility only.

This difference is subtle but important in terms of speed and usability. When the state changes in `if`, the template and all of its children are deleted from the DOM, which is computationally expensive if it's being done over and over. However, if `show` is being used for a very large template, such as a dashboard containing thousands of elements with their own bound data, then keeping those elements loaded-but-hidden may not end up being a useful approach.

If we just want to hide the element from view instead of removing it from the DOM completely, we should use `show` instead of `if`. Let's look at the same basic "Hello World" from above that asks the user if they want to greet the world, this time with `show` instead of `if`.

{% code title="my-app.html" %}
```markup
<label for="greet">Would you like me to greet the world?</label>
<input type="checkbox" id="greet" checked.bind="greet">
<div show.bind="greet">
  Hello, World!
</div>
```
{% endcode %}

When unchecked, our "Hello World" div will have the `aurelia-hide` class, which sets `display: none` if you're using Aurelia's default CSS. However, if you don't want to do that, you can also define your own CSS rules that treat `aurelia-hide` differently, like setting `visibility: none` or `height: 0px`.

What about the scenario above with `one-time`? Should we use `show.one-time` in the same way? If we think about what `show` does, it doesn't really make sense. We're saying we want a CSS class to be applied that will hide an element, and that it will never change. In most cases, we want `if` to refuse to create an element we'll never use in the first place.

## switch

To deal with conditional rendering Aurelia also provides the `switch` template controller. It behaves like `if/else` in terms of that it does detach the elements from DOM, when the condition does not satisfy. The difference being is that it brings the intrinsic flexibility and semantics of using a `switch` statement with it.

A typical use-case of `switch` involves dealing with enums. For example, let's consider the following `Status` enum.

{% code title="Status.ts" %}
```typescript
const enum Status {
  received   = 'received',
  processing = 'processing',
  dispatched = 'dispatched',
  delivered  = 'delivered',
  unknown    = 'unknown',
}
```
{% endcode %}

When tasked with displaying a specific text for a specific member \(status\) of the `Status` enum, with only `if` bind at our disposal, we may end up with the following markup.

{% code title="my-app.html" %}
```markup
<span if.bind="status === 'received'">Order received.</span>
<span if.bind="status === 'processing'">Processing your order.</span>
<span if.bind="status === 'dispatched'">On the way.</span>
<span if.bind="status === 'delivered'">Delivered.</span>
```
{% endcode %}

Also if there are new statuses added to the `Status` enum in future, this markup will end up more verbose, and possibly difficult to understand. Moreover, the semantics of the code might as well be somewhat lost. With the usage of the `switch/case` template controller, the above markup can be written as following.

{% code title="my-app.html" %}
```markup
<template switch.bind="status">
  <span case="received">Order received.</span>
  <span case="processing">Processing your order.</span>
  <span case="dispatched">On the way.</span>
  <span case="delivered">Delivered.</span>
</template>
```
{% endcode %}

This behaves in similar fashion a `switch` in JavaScript behaves. That is it renders the first match, and ignores the rest. For example if the `status` has a value `Status.processing`, it will render `<span>Processing your order.</span>`. Note that it intrinsically avoids matching the following `case`s after the first match and consequently binding and rendering those elements. That is the basic and typical use-case of the `switch/case` template controllers. Now let's see some other features of this as well.

### default-case

The `switch` also supports `default-case`; i.e. this "case" will be matched, if nothing else is matched.

{% code title="my-app.html" %}
```markup
<template switch.bind="status">
  <span case="received">Order received.</span>
  <span case="processing">Processing your order.</span>
  <span case="dispatched">On the way.</span>
  <span default-case>Unknown.</span>
</template>
```
{% endcode %}

With this markup, if the `status` is set to `Status.unknown` or `Status.delivered`, `<span>Unknown.</span>` will be rendered.

### multi-case

It is possible to map a single element to multiple cases, by binding an array to the `case`.

{% code title="my-app.html" %}
```markup
<template switch.bind="status">
  <span case.bind="['received', 'processing']">Order received.</span>
  <span case="dispatched">On the way.</span>
  <span case="delivered">Delivered.</span>
</template>
```
{% endcode %}

For either of `Status.received` or `Status.processing`, it will render `<span>Order received.</span>`. A JavaScript equivalent of this would be the following.

{% code title="my-app.ts" %}
```typescript
switch(status) {
  case Status.received:
  case Status.processing:
    return 'Order received.';
  case Status.dispatched:
    return 'On the way.';
  case Status.delivered:
    return 'Delivered.';
}
```
{% endcode %}

{% hint style="info" %}
When an array is bound to the `case`, the value of the `switch` is matched against the items in the array and not with the array reference.
{% endhint %}

### fall-through

It is also possible to have the switch-case fallthrough in the markup, where you don't want to break after a case has been executed. This means something like this.

{% code title="my-app.ts" %}
```typescript
let ret: string = "";
switch(status) {
  case Status.received:
    ret = 'Order received.';
  case Status.processing:
    ret =`${ret}, Order received.`;
    break;
  case Status.dispatched:
    ret = 'On the way.';
    break;
  case Status.delivered:
    ret = 'Delivered.';
    break;
}
return ret;
```
{% endcode %}

Aurelia equivalent of this will be the following.

{% code title="my-app.html" %}
```markup
<template switch.bind="status">
  <span case="value.bind:'received'; fall-through.bind: true">Order received.</span>
  <span case="processing">Processing your order.</span>
  <span case="dispatched">On the way.</span>
  <span case="delivered">Delivered.</span>
</template>
```
{% endcode %}

Assuming that `status` is set to `Status.received`, it will end up the rendering the first two `<span>`s.

{% hint style="info" %}
* By default for every `case` `fallThrough` is set to `false`. If needed, you need to set it to `true` explicitly. This the reason why we don't need to write the following: `<span case="value.bind:'processing'; fall-through.bind: false">Processing your order.</span>`.
* `fall-through: true` is a less verbose syntax for binding the value of `fallThrough`. In this case, the string `'true'` and `'false'` are converted to boolean `true`, and `false` respectively.
{% endhint %}

### Miscellaneous examples

This section includes few more interesting examples that you might encounter in real life, and the statutory warnings.

* Another usage of switch that we often see in the wild, is to use a static expression for `switch` and more dynamic expression for `case`. Therefore, the following is a valid usage of `switch`.

  {% code title="my-app.html" %}
  ```markup
  <template>
    <template repeat.for="num of 100">
      <template switch.bind="true">
        <span case.bind="num % 3 === 0 && num % 5 === 0">FizzBuzz</span>
        <span case.bind="num % 3 === 0">Fizz</span>
        <span case.bind="num % 5 === 0">Buzz</span>
      </template>
    </template>
  </template>
  ```
  {% endcode %}

* The `switch` can be used to provide conditional projection to `au-slot`. The following markup is rendered as `'<foo-bar> <span>Order received.</span> </foo-bar>'` with `status` set to `Status.received`.

  {% code title="my-app.html" %}
  ```markup
  <template as-custom-element="foo-bar">
    <au-slot name="s1"></au-slot>
  </template>

  <foo-bar>
    <template au-slot="s1">
      <template switch.bind="status">
        <span case="received">Order received.</span>
        <span case="dispatched">On the way.</span>
        <span case="processing">Processing your order.</span>
        <span case="delivered">Delivered.</span>
      </template>
    </template>
  </foo-bar>
  ```
  {% endcode %}

* The `case` can be used with `<au-slot>` element as well. The following markup is rendered as `'<foo-bar> <div> <span>Projection</span> </div> </foo-bar>'` with `status` set to `Status.received`.

  {% code title="my-app.html" %}
  ```markup
  <template as-custom-element="foo-bar">
    <bindable property="status"></bindable>
    <div switch.bind="status">
      <au-slot name="s1" case="received">Order received.</au-slot>
      <au-slot name="s2" case="dispatched">On the way.</au-slot>
      <au-slot name="s3" case="processing">Processing your order.</au-slot>
      <au-slot name="s4" case="delivered">Delivered.</au-slot>
    </div>
  </template>

  <foo-bar status.bind="status">
    <span au-slot="s1">Projection</span>
  </foo-bar>
  ```
  {% endcode %}

* `switch`s can be nested. For example, the following markup is rendered as `<span> Expected to be delivered in 2 days. </span>` with `status` set to `Status.delivered`.

  {% code title="my-app.html" %}
  ```markup
  <template>
    <let day.bind="2"></let>
    <template switch.bind="status">
      <span case="received">Order received.</span>
      <span case="dispatched">On the way.</span>
      <span case="processing">Processing your order.</span>
      <span case="delivered" switch.bind="day">
        Expected to be delivered
        <template case.bind="1">tomorrow.</template>
        <template case.bind="2">in 2 days.</template>
        <template default-case>in few days.</template>
      </span>
    </template>
  </template>
  ```
  {% endcode %}

* `switch` can work without any `case` attribute in it. However, the `case` cannot be used with the `switch` applied to its parent. This applies to the `default-case` as well.

  {% code title="my-app.html" %}
  ```markup
  <!-- this works! -->
  <div switch.bind="status">
    the curious case of \${status}
  </div>

  <!-- this throws error! -->
  <span case="foo"></span>
  ```
  {% endcode %}

* In fact, it is worth noting that `case` should be the direct child of `switch`. In most of the cases Aurelia will throw error otherwise in most of the cases; for other cases, it might lead to unexpected results. If you think, any of the following should be supported, then let us know your use-case.

  {% code title="my-app.html" %}
  ```markup
  <!-- These do NOT work! -->
  <!-- #1: usage with `if` -->
  <template>
    <template switch.bind="status">
      <template if.bind="true">
        <span case="delivered">delivered</span>
      </template>
    </template>
  </template>

  <!-- #2: usage with `repeat.for` -->
  <template>
    <template switch.bind="status">
      <template repeat.for="s of ['received','dispatched','processing','delivered',]">
        <span case.bind="s">\${s}</span>
      </template>
    </template>
  </template>

  <!-- #3: usage with `au-slot` -->
  <template as-custom-element="foo-bar">
    <au-slot name="s1"></au-slot>
  </template>

  <foo-bar switch.bind="status">
    <template au-slot="s1">
      <span case="dispatched">On the way.</span>
      <span case="delivered">Delivered.</span>
    </template>
  </foo-bar>

  <!--
    The following example does produce some sort of output;
    but such usage is not supported.
  -->
  <template as-custom-element="foo-bar">
    foo bar
  </template>

  <template switch.bind="status">
    <foo-bar>
      <span case="dispatched">On the way.</span>
      <span case="delivered">Delivered.</span>
    </foo-bar>
  </template>
  <!--
    With `status` set to 'dispatched' it produces this output:
    `<foo-bar> <span>On the way.</span> foo bar </foo-bar>`
  -->
  ```
  {% endcode %}

## promise

The `promise` template controller enables us to render different content based on the status of a promise. A basic example is shown below.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="my-app.html" %}
```markup
<div promise.bind="promise1">
 <template pending>The promise is not yet settled.</template>
 <template then.from-view="data">The promise is resolved with ${data}.</template>         <!-- grab the resolved value -->
 <template catch.from-view="err">This promise is rejected with ${err.message}.</template> <!-- grab the rejection reason -->
</div>

<div promise.bind="promise2">
 <template pending>The promise is not yet settled.</template>
 <template then>The promise is resolved.</template>
 <template catch>This promise is rejected.</template>
</div>
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="my-app.ts" %}
```typescript
export class MyApp {
  private promise1: Promise<any>;
  private promise2: Promise<any>;

  public binding() {
    this.promise1 = this.fetchFoo();
    this.promise2 = this.fetchBar();
  }

  private fetchFoo(): Promise<any> {
    // return a promise
  }

  private fetchBar(): Promise<any> {
    // return a promise
  }
}
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

As it can be seen in the example above, there are three more companion template controllers: `pending`, `then`, and `catch`. The content under `pending` is shown till the promise is settled. Once the promise is settled, depending on whether the promise is resolved, or rejected, the content under `then`, or `catch` will be shown respectively. Moreover, after the promise is settled, the content under the `pending` is detached from the DOM.

Another important point to note here is that the resolved data from the promise can be accessed using the bound property with `then` \(in the example above, it is `data`\). Similarly, the rejection error/reason can be accessed using the bound property with `catch` \(in the example above, it is `err`\). The usage of these settled values are optional; that is both `then` and `catch` can be used without binding to any property.

Contextually, it should be clarified here that the usage of `from-view` binding mode for `then`, and `catch` is intentional, as other binding mode in this context would not make much sense.

### Motivation

The need for this template controller originated from the use-case of showing partial content in the view while another part of the view that is dependent on the promise, waits.

```markup
<span> promise-independent content </span>

<template promise.bind="generalInfoPromise">
 <template pending>Fetching info...</template>
 <template then.from-view="info">${info.name} ${info.age}</template>
 <template catch.from-view="err1">Cannot get the general information</template>
</template>

<template promise.bind="addressInfoPromise">
 <template pending>Fetching address info...</template>
 <template then.from-view="address">${address.pin} ${address.city}</template>
 <template catch.from-view="err2">Cannot get the address information</template>
</template>
```

In the example above the `span` will be shown independently of the status of either `generalInfoPromise`, or `addressInfoPromise`. The section dependent on each of those promise will attach DOM Elements according to the status of each promises, at the same time being independent of each other.

### Scoping

The `promise` template controller creates its own scope. This prevents accidentally polluting the parent scope or the view model where this template controller is used. Let use see an example to understand what it means.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="my-app.html" %}
```markup
<div promise.bind="promise">
 <foo-bar then.from-view="data" foo-data.bind="data"></foo-bar>
 <fizz-buzz catch.from-view="err" fizz-err.bind="err"></fizz-buzz>
</div>
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="my-app.ts" %}
```typescript
export class MyApp {
  public data: any;
}
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

In the example above, we are storing the resolved value from the promise in the `data` property, and then passing the value to the `foo-bar` custom element by binding the `foo-data` property. Due to the fact that `promise` creates its own scope, this does not add a property to the binding context. This means that for the example above the `data` property in `MyApp` stays uninitialized \(more precisely, the `data` property never end up being in the instance of `MyApp`\). This is useful when we need the data only in view for passing from one component to another custom element, as it does not pollute the underlying view-model. Note that this does not make any difference in terms of data binding or change observation. However, when we do need to access the settled data inside the view model, we can use the `$parent.data` or `$parent.err` as shown in the example below.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="my-app.html" %}
```markup
<div promise.bind="promise">
 <foo-bar then="$parent.data"></foo-bar>
 <fizz-buzz catch="$parent.err"></fizz-buzz>
</div>
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="my-app.ts" %}
```typescript
export class MyApp {
  public data: any;   // the resolved data is assigned to this once and when the promise is resolved
  public err: Error; // the rejected reason is assigned to this once and when the promise is resolved
}
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

Another interesting aspect of this scoping is that now we can write the following markup.

{% code title="my-app.html" %}
```markup
<template promise.bind="generalInfoPromise">
 <template pending>Fetching info...</template>
 <template then.from-view="data">${data.name} ${data.age}</template>
 <template catch.from-view="err">Cannot get the general information</template>
</template>

<template promise.bind="addressInfoPromise">
 <template pending>Fetching address info...</template>
 <template then.from-view="data">${data.pin} ${data.city}</template>
 <template catch.from-view="err">Cannot get the address information</template>
</template>
```
{% endcode %}

Note that the mark up uses 2 different promises but uses `data` property in both cases to grab the resolved data. Same can be observed for `err` as well. However, as separate scopes are created by every `promise`, the two `data` properties are actually two different properties in two different scopes. Without separate scope, we necessarily need to use two properties with different names in this case \(that can also be done even in this case, not necessarily\).

{% hint style="info" %}
In case you are interested about the details on scoping and binding context, you can refer to the [Scope and context documentation](https://github.com/aurelia/aurelia/tree/3823c8ef549f352e308bb1b5892a5b9a4eacee9a/docs/user-docs/app-basics/scope-and-binding-context/README.md).
{% endhint %}

### Nesting

The template controllers can be nested.

{% code title="my-app.html" %}
```markup
<template promise.bind="fetchPromise">
 <template pending>Fetching...</template>
 <template then.from-view="response" promise.bind="response.json()">
   <template then.from-view="data">${data}</template>
   <template catch>Deserialization error</template>
 </template>
 <template catch.from-view="err2">Cannot fetch</template>
</template>
```
{% endcode %}

### Using it inside repeat.for

Due to the way the scoping and binding context resolution works \(refer to the [Scope and context documentation](https://github.com/aurelia/aurelia/tree/3823c8ef549f352e308bb1b5892a5b9a4eacee9a/docs/user-docs/app-basics/scope-and-binding-context/README.md)\), you might want to use a `let` binding when using the `promise` inside `repeat.for`. This is shown in the example below.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="my-app.html" %}
```markup
<template>
  <let items.bind="[[42, true], ['foo-bar', false], ['forty-two', true], ['fizz-bazz', false]]"></let>
  <template repeat.for="item of items">
    <template promise.bind="item[0] | promisify:item[1]">
      <let data.bind="null" err.bind="null"></let>
      <span then.from-view="data">${data}</span>
      <span catch.from-view="err">${err.message}</span>
    </template>
  </template>
</template>
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="promisify.ts" %}
```typescript
import {
  valueConverter,
} from '@aurelia/runtime-html';

@valueConverter('promisify')
class Promisify {
  public toView(value: unknown, resolve: boolean = true): Promise<unknown> {
    return resolve
      ? Promise.resolve(value)
      : Promise.reject(new Error(String(value)));
  }
}
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

The above example shows an usage involving `repeat.for` chained with a `promisify` value converter. The value converter converts a simple value to a resolving or rejecting promise depending on the second boolean value passed to it. The value converter in itself is not that important for this discussion. It is used to construct a `repeat.for`, `promise` combination easily.

The important thing to note here is the usage of `let` binding that forces creation of two properties, namely `data` and `err`, in the override context which gets higher precedence while binding. Without these properties in the override context, the properties gets created in the binding context, which eventually gets overwritten with the second iteration of the repeat. In short, with `let` binding in place the output looks like as follows.

```markup
<span>42</span>
<span>foo-bar</span>
<span>forty-two</span>
<span>fizz-bazz</span>
```

Whereas without the `let` binding, the result looks like below that does not match the general expectation.

```markup
<span>forty-two</span>
<span>fizz-bazz</span>
<span>forty-two</span>
<span>fizz-bazz</span>
```

### Restriction

The `pending`, `then`, and `catch` can not be used in isolation without the `promise` template controller. That is each one of the following examples throws error.

{% code title="my-app.html" %}
```markup
<template pending>does not work</template>
<template then>does not work</template>
<template catch>does not work</template>
```
{% endcode %}

However, `promise` template controller can be used without any of those three template controllers. Following are some valid examples.

{% code title="my-app.html" %}
```markup
<template promise.bind="promise">
</template>

<template promise.bind="promise">
 <template pending>Please wait...</template>
</template>

<template promise.bind="promise">
 <template then="data">...</template>
 <template catch="err">...</template>
</template>
```
{% endcode %}

It is important to note here that those three template controllers cannot be used under any template controller other than `promise`. Following are some invalid examples.

{% code title="my-app.html" %}
```markup
<template promise.bind="generalInfoPromise">
 <template if.bind="true" pending>Fetching info...</template> <!--Here pending gets nested under if.bind-->
 <template then.from-view="info">${info.name} ${info.age}</template>
 <template catch.from-view="err1">Cannot get the general information</template>
</template>

<template promise.bind="generalInfoPromise">
 <template repeat.for="i of 10" then.from-view="info">${info.name} ${info.age}</template>  <!--Here pending gets nested under repeat.for-->
 <template catch.from-view="err1">Cannot get the general information</template>
</template>
```
{% endcode %}

However, the following are some valid examples of combining other template controllers.

{% code title="my-app.html" %}
```markup
<template promise.bind="generalInfoPromise">
 <template pending if.bind="someCondition">Fetching info...</template>
 <template then.from-view="info">${info.name} ${info.age}</template>
 <template catch.from-view="err1">Cannot get the general information</template>
</template>

<template promise.bind="generalInfoPromise">
 <template then.from-view="items" repeat.for="item of item">${item.name}</template>
 <template catch.from-view="err1">Cannot get the general information</template>
</template>
```
{% endcode %}
