## Steps

1. [Step 1: Project setup + app shell](step-1-project-setup.md)
2. [Step 2: Routing + nested layouts](step-2-routing-and-layout.md)
3. [Step 3: Overview page + filters + events](step-3-projects-overview.md)
4. [Step 4: Detail route + guards](step-4-project-detail-and-guards.md)
5. [Step 5 (Optional): Router events + polish](step-5-router-events-and-polish.md)
