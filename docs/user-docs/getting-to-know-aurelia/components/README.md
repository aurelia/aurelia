description: Understand Aurelia components, custom elements, bindables, and how they relate to view composition.

# Components

Aurelia components (custom elements and attributes) are the building blocks of every view. Start with the guides below to learn how to author and consume them:

- [Creating components](creating-components/consuming-a-custom-element.md) – Walk through declaring a custom element and wiring it into a page.
- [Bindable setter patterns](bindable-setter.md) – Explore techniques for reacting to incoming bindable values.

As you progress through the rest of “Getting to Know Aurelia,” you’ll see components combined with template controllers, dynamic composition, and routing to form larger features.
