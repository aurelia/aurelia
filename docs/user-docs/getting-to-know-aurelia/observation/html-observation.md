# HTML observation

## Quick introduction

HTML elements are special objects that often require different observation strategies, and most of the time, listening to some specific event is the preferred way. For this reason, Aurelia encourages using events to observe HTML elements.

As an example, the `value` property of an `<input />` element should be observed by listening to the `<input />` change events such as `input` or `change` on the element. Another example is the `value` property of a `<select />` element should be observed by listening to the `change` event on it.

By default, the observation of HTML elements is done using a default node observer locator implementation. This default locator has a basic set of APIs that allows users to teach Aurelia how to observe HTML element observation effectively.

The following is the trimmed interface of the node observer locator, highlighting its capability to learn how to observe HTML elements:

```typescript
export class NodeObserverLocator {
  allowDirtyCheck: boolean;
  handles(obj, key, requestor): boolean;

  useConfig(config): void;
  useConfig(nodeName, key, eventsConfig): void;

  useConfigGlobal(config): void;
  useConfigGlobal(key, eventsConfig): void;
}
```

`useConfig` and `useConfigGlobal` are two methods that can be used to teach the default node observer locator what events can be used to observe a property of a specific element or any element.

## Node observer examples

Using the `nodeObserverLocator` API, we can tell Aurelia how to observe properties of HTML elements for changes. Under the hood, Aurelia already observes properties like values on form inputs, but it is good to understand how this functionality works, especially for custom elements and web components.

### How to teach Aurelia to observe the `value` property of a `<textarea />` element:

```typescript
nodeObserverLocator.useConfig('textarea', 'value', { events: ['input', 'change'] });
```

In this example, the `eventsConfig` argument has the value `{ events: ['input', 'change']}`.

### How to teach Aurelia to observe property `length` of an `<input />` element:

```typescript
nodeObserverLocator.useConfig('input', 'length', { events: ['input'] });
```

In this example, `eventsConfig` argument has the value `{ events: ['input']}`.

### How to teach Aurelia observe property `scrollTop` of all elements:

```typescript
nodeObserverLocator.useConfigGlobal('scrollTop', { events: ['scroll'] });
```

In this example, `eventsConfig` argument has the value `{ events: ['scroll']}`.

## Observing custom elements in Web Components

It should be the same as observing custom (HTML) elements and normal HTML elements. It is common for Web Components to have well-defined events associated with their custom properties, so observing them often means adding a few configuration lines.

An example of how to teach Aurelia to observe the `value` property of a `<my-input />` element, and `<my-input />` dispatches `valueChanged` event when its value has been changed:

```typescript
nodeObserverLocator.useConfig('my-input', 'value', { events: ['valueChanged'] });
```
