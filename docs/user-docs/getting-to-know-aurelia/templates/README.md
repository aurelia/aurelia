# Templates

In Aurelia, templates underpin most of what you will do in your applications. A template in Aurelia is enhanced HTML that utilizes special markup to help you build applications. While certain aspects of templating in Aurelia deviate slightly from HTML, one of Aurelia's guiding principles is adhering to the HTML specification. In-fact, all HTML in Aurelia is valid HTML.

Please consult the sub-sections for templating specific documentation.
