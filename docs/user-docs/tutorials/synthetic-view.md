  Learn how you can dynamically synthesize view from templates generated on
  runtime.

# Synthetic view

While you can use the `enhance` API to hydrate dynamically (on runtime) generated templates, this tutorial shows some primitives to do the same with more controls to you.

## What we will be building

* We will write two custom elements. To make it easy to follow the custom elements are intentionally made trivial.
* Then we will generate a template that is constructed on runtime using these custom elements.
* Finally we will use lower level Aurelia APIs such as `ViewFactory` and `Controller` to hydrate the template.

You can see a working example [here](https://stackblitz.com/edit/typescript-hh9a1e).
{% endhint %}

## Prerequisites

Before going any further, you should be familiar with some basic Aurelia concepts as well as some fundamental Javascript ones as well. While these are not hard prerequisites, please know that some concepts used in this tutorial out of context might be confusing or difficult to understand.

* Creating a new Aurelia app. This won't be covered in this tutorial and you may refer the other tutorials to this end.
* You have familiarized yourself with the [Aurelia template syntax](broken-reference/).
* You have familiarized yourself with [components in Aurelia](../getting-to-know-aurelia/components.md).
* You are familiar with [Dependency Injection](../getting-to-know-aurelia/dependency-injection-di.md). You don't need to be a master of it, just familiar with its existence and why it matters in Aurelia.
* Native Web APIs, such as [`createElement`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/createElement).

## Custom elements

First, let us write some custom elements. These custom elements will be rather simplistic in nature so that we don't get tangled into the logic of complex custom elements too much. To this end we will have two custom elements, namely `normal-text` and `value-text`. These custom-elements display a bound `value` inside a `<span>` and a `<strong>` element respectively as shown in the following code fragment.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="custom-elements.ts" %}
```typescript
import { bindable, customElement } from '@aurelia/runtime-html';

@customElement({
  name: 'normal-text',

  //the template is inlined for ease of demonstration; feel free to import the template from an external html file.
  template: '<span>NT: ${value}</span>',
})
export class NormalText {
  @bindable value: unknown;
}

@customElement({
  name: 'value-text',

  //the template is inlined for ease of demonstration; feel free to import the template from an external html file.
  template: '<strong>VT: ${value}</strong>',
})
export class ValueText {
  @bindable value: unknown;
}
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="main.ts" %}
```typescript
import { Aurelia, StandardConfiguration } from '@aurelia/runtime-html';
import { NormalText, ValueText } from './custom-elements';

(async function () {
  await new Aurelia()
    .register(
      StandardConfiguration,

      /*--- Register the custom elements ---*/
      NormalText,
      ValueText,
    )
    //...
    ;
})().catch(console.error);
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

Make sure that you have registered those custom elements.

## Setup the `App`

Let us assume that the starting point of our app is as follows.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="app.ts" %}
```typescript
import { ICustomElementViewModel } from '@aurelia/runtime-html';
import { customElement } from 'aurelia';
import template from './app.html';

@customElement({ name: 'app', template })
export class App {
  private containerEl: HTMLDivElement;
  private readonly bc = { value: 'Hello Aurelia!' };

  private async add() {
    // TODO add code here to compose dynamic template and hydrate
  }

  private async remove() {
    // TODO add code here to remove the hydrated
  }
}
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="app.html" %}
```html
${bc.message} <br>

<!-- we would like to add the hydrated custom elements when this button is clicked -->
<button click.delegate="add()">Add CEs</button>

<!-- we would like to remove the hydrated custom elements when this button is clicked -->
<button click.delegate="remove()">Remove CEs</button>

<br>
<!-- This is where we would like add our hydrated elements -->
<div ref="containerEl"></div>
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

The idea is to add the dynamically generated and hydrated nodes in the `div[ref=containerEl]` using the `add` method and remove those using the `remove` method.

## Synthesize the view

The process of dynamically adding the hydrated nodes can be broadly divided into the following steps:

1. Create the DOM fragment under a single root node.
2. Add the root node to the DOM.
3. Convert the root node to a render location to which Aurelia can later add the hydrated nodes.
4. Create a `ViewFactory`.
5. Create a `ISyntheticView` using the view factory and activate.

In the first step we generate the DOM fragment using simple Web APIs. Our goal for this tutorial is to create the following DOM fragment.

```html
<normal-text value.bind></normal-text>
<br>
<value-text value.bind></value-text>
```

{% hint style="info" %}
The dynamically generated nodes need not necessarily be only custom elements. Native elements can also be hydrated the same way.
{% endhint %}

To this end, we inject a `IPlatform` instance to our `App` instead of directly using the global Web APIs. This is recommended because it makes the testing easier.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="app.ts" %}
```typescript
import {
  IPlatform,
  //...
} from '@aurelia/runtime-html';
//...

export class App {
  //...
  public constructor(
    @IPlatform private readonly platform: IPlatform,
  ){}
}
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

Next we proceed to prepare the DOM fragment inside the `add` method.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="app.ts" %}
```typescript
//...
export class App {
  //...
  public async add() {

    // Step#1: Create the template.
    const doc = this.platform.document;
    // synthetic view root
    const template: HTMLTemplateElement = doc.createElement('template');
    const content = template.content;

    const normalText = doc.createElement('normal-text');
    normalText.setAttribute('value.bind', '');

    const valueText = doc.createElement('value-text');
    valueText.setAttribute('value.bind', '');

    content.append(
      normalText,
      doc.createElement('br'),
      valueText
    );
  }
}
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

In the next step we need to add this fragment to the DOM and to this end we would like to use the `div[ref=containerEl]` to be the parent of the `template`.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="app.ts" %}
```typescript
//...
export class App {
  //...
  public async add() {
    //...
    // Step#2: Add the template to the DOM
    this.containerEl.append(template);
  }
}
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

Then we convert the `template` to a render location. This process adds a marker, as render location, in the DOM where the hydrated nodes will be attached later.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="app.ts" %}
```typescript
import {
  convertToRenderLocation,
  //...
} from '@aurelia/runtime-html';
//...
export class App {
  //...
  public async add() {
    //...
    // Step#3: Convert the node to a render location so that Aurelia can attach the hydrated nodes back to correct location during activate
    const loc = convertToRenderLocation(template);
  }
}
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

After that we need to create a view factory from the template. The objective of creating a view factory is simply, as the name already suggests, to create a view later from it.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="app.ts" %}
```typescript
import {
  CustomElementDefinition,
  CustomElement,
  ViewFactory,
  //...
} from '@aurelia/runtime-html';
import {
  IContainer,
  //...
} from 'aurelia';
//...
export class App {
  //...
  public constructor(
    @IContainer private readonly container: IContainer,
    //...
  ){}

  public async add() {
    //...
    // Step#4: Create view factory
    // create a custom-element definition from the template.
    // The view later will be created from this definition
    const definition = CustomElementDefinition.create({
      // we have used here a auto-generated name to avoid collision; you may choose an explicit name if you want to.
      name: CustomElement.generateName(),
      template,
    });
    const factory = new ViewFactory(this.container, definition);
  }
}
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

Note that to create the view factory we need a container, which is injected via the `App` constructor.

With that our preparation is almost done. The next step involves creating a view from the view factory and activating it.

To activate the view however, we need to use a "parent" controller. This is needed as a hierarchical structure in maintained on controller-level. Because we are creating the view from `App`, it makes sense to use the controller from the `App` to this end. Aurelia adds a controller to every view custom element view model (as well as custom attribute view model) once the view model is created.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="app.ts" %}
```typescript
import {
  ICustomElementViewModel,
  ICustomElementController,
  //...
} from '@aurelia/runtime-html';
//...
export class App implements ICustomElementViewModel {
  //...
  // This is set by the controller after this instance is constructed.
  public readonly $controller!: ICustomElementController<this>;
  //...
}
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

We use this controller to create the view from view factory.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="app.ts" %}
```typescript
import {
  ISyntheticView,
  LifecycleFlags,
  //...
} from '@aurelia/runtime-html';
import {
  Scope,
  //...
} from '@aurelia/runtime';
//...
export class App implements ICustomElementViewModel {
  private view: ISyntheticView | undefined;
  private readonly bc = { value: 'Hello Aurelia!' };
  //...

  public async add() {
    //...
    // Step#5: Create and activate view
    const view = this.view = factory
      .create(controller)
      .setLocation(loc); //<-- render location created in Step#2

    // binds the view with the given scope and attaches it to the DOM
    await view.activate(
      view,
      controller,
      LifecycleFlags.none,
      Scope.create(this.bc),
    );
  }
}
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

In this step the view is created from the factory and the render location is set. Subsequently, the view is activated, which involves mainly binding the view with the given scope and attaching the hydrated nodes to the render location.

In this example, a new scope is created, to bind the view, for simplicity. However, if you want to avoid that you may reuse the same scope from the `controller` itself (see [example](https://stackblitz.com/edit/typescript-pzef4n?file=app%2Fapp.ts)) or use that as parent scope depending on your need. To know more about scope and context refer the respective [documentation](../components/scope-and-binding-context.md). Once the activation is complete you can see the hydrated nodes in DOM.

## Remove the view

You may have noticed that we have stored the view in the `App#view` property. Removing involves simply deactivating the view.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="app.ts" %}
```typescript
//...
export class App implements ICustomElementViewModel {
  //...
  private async remove() {
    await this.view.deactivate(view, this.$controller, LifecycleFlags.none);
  }
}
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Note that the `view` can be kept around and can be activated or deactivated on-demand.
{% endhint %}

It also might be a good idea to dispose the `view` from the `dispose` hook of the view-model to ensure systematic disposal of the view and the associated resources.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="app.ts" %}
```typescript
import {
  Controller,
  //...
} from '@aurelia/runtime-html';
//...
export class App implements ICustomElementViewModel {
  //...
  public dispose() {
    (this.view as Controller).dispose();
    this.view = undefined;
  }
}
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Live example

You can see the live example below. It involves some trivial guard conditions; other than that it is mostly the same.
