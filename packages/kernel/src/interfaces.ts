/**
 * A helper interface for declaring strongly typed decorators.
 *
 * The `Decoratable` and `Decorated` types are intended to be used together, where
 * `Decoratable` describes the (not yet decorated) target class and `Decorated`
 * describes the same target class *after* the decorator was applied to it.
 *
 * `TRequired` dictates the preconditions that the target class must conform to,
 * and `TOptional` describes the postconditions that the decorator will make the class conform
 * to. The end result (return value of the decorator) is a combination of `TOptional & TRequired`
 * where all properties/methods are defined.
 *
 * ### How it works:
 *
 * The `TOptional` and `TRequired` type arguments in the `Decoratable` interface relate
 * to the target class that the decorator will be applied to.
 * As the names imply, properties/methods defined in the `TOptional` type are optional
 * and those defined in `TRequired` are required.
 *
 * In the `Decorated` interface, the `TOptional` type argument's name is a bit misleading.
 * It is in fact transformed into a required property: it's the decorator's job to
 * add it to the prototype. They are named the same to emphasize that the type arguments
 * passed to `Decoratable` and `Decorated` must be the same.
 *
 * Example:
 *
```ts
// Neither bind() nor attach() need to be present,
// so we pass them both to TOptional. The only constraint
// for TRequired is that it must be a class, so we give
// it a type that must extend Constructable
interface IBind { bind(): void; }
interface IAttach { attach(): void; }

function customElement1<T extends Constructable>(target: Decoratable<IBind & IAttach, T>):  Decorated<IBind & IAttach, T> {
  target.prototype.bind = () => {};
  target.prototype.attach = () => {};
  return target;
}
@customElement1 // no errors
class ViewModel1 {}

// IBind is now required instead of optional
function customElement2<T extends Constructable>(target: Decoratable<IAttach, T & IBind>): Decorated<IAttach, T & IBind> {
  // this decorator apparently needs a bind()
  // method to already be defined
  target.prototype.attach = () => {};
  return target;
}
@customElement2 // type error: property 'bind' is missing
class ViewModel2 {}

@customElement2 // no errors
class ViewModel3 { public bind(): void {} }

const vm3 = new ViewModel3();
vm3.attach(); // type error: property 'attach' does not exist
// (eventhough the decorator added it)

const ViewModel4 = customElement2(ViewModel3);
const vm4 = new ViewModel4();
vm4.attach(); // no errors because we're instantiating the
// returned value from the decorator, which is the
// modified type
```

/* Note: the intent of TOptional on Decoratable was/is to have those properties declared
on the prototype of the incoming class so that you would not get a type error when trying
to assign properties/methods to the prototype to an incoming prototype of type `{}`.
But actually applying this requires a certain interplay with the Constructable type
(it requires type constraints on the type of the `prototype` property) that doesn't work
too well (yet) in the type system as of version 3.0.x.
We tried this, but it results in various false negatives where target classes seem to not
conform to the Constructable type.
With the incoming prototype currently being of type `any`, the TOptional type argument
on Decoratable technically has no effect whatsoever, but the intent is to try and make
it work like this at some point - either if the type system supports this design or if
we learn some trick to accomplish this in another way.

  // Constructor signatures are impossible to type correctly for use by decorators, because a synthetic constructor signature is expected to return "void"
  // but a normal constructor signature is expected to return the type that they construct.
  // Furthermore, using merged types will cause either to fail without using conditional types as well.
  // If using conditional types correctly, they would need to have intimate knowledge of any type they might be applied to (or they will still cause typing
  // errors in valid edge cases), which in turn is impossible to predict because there will be user code involved that might not fulfill any particular contract.
  // In short, the type system (as of 3.1.x) is simply not (yet?) capable of correctly handling decorators and there is nothing here that will work in all cases except for "any".

// and it should remind us of the fact that we have more work to do in making typings across the runtime more accurate.
// For changing this "any" to "unknown", we could either resort to upcasting at the consumer side of things (less preferable because unsafe)
