/**
 * The EndpointMatcher finds endpoints, viewports and viewport scopes, that matches routing instructions' criteria.
 * It works based on RoutingScope and is a pure helper class to it. The only public method, `matchEndpoints`, is
 * invoked on two occassions during a navigation:
 * - when the router is looking for the matching endpoints to the routing instructions in a navigation, and
 * - when the router is looking for the minimum way to describe the full current state of all endpoints. In this
 * second invokation, pre-existing matching endpoints on the routing instruction are ignored.
 *
 * It mutates the actual routing instructions in which is good for the first occassion but requires a cloning of
 * the routing instructions representing the full current state before the second invokation.
 *
 * Endpoints are matched in priority order
 * 1) already existing instances (skipped in second occassion, minimum descripton of full state)
 * 2) viewport scope matching segment (component/path part)
 * 3) component configuration on viewports (used-by)
 * 4) viewport (non-instance) specified in routing instruction (skipped in second occassion, minimum descripton)
 * 5) if there's a single available viewport last
 * 6) viewport specified in routing instruction (only in second occassion, minimum descripton)
