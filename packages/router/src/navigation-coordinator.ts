/**
 * The navigation coordinator coordinates navigation between endpoints/entities
 * and their navigation states. The coordinator keeps the endpoints synchronized
 * for the configured synchronization states, meaning that no endpoint can proceed
 * past a sync state until all endpoints have reached it. The coordinator also
 * provides synchronization on endpoint level which is used to make sure parent
 * hooks are done before child hooks start.
 *
 * Each endpoint that's involved in a navigation is added to the coordinator's
 * entities and report each completed navigation state to the coordinator
 * during the transition. Before an endpoint starts a new navigation step
 * it asks the coordinator whether it can proceed or should wait. The
 * coordinator instructs continuation if the endpoint's current step isn't
 * being synchronized or if all other endpoints have reached that state. If
 * one or more endpoints have been instructed to wait, they are instructed
 * to continue once all endpoints have reached the state they're waiting on.
