  // method has one consumer: the compose element. The compose element uses this
  // to create an IVisual based on a dynamically determined component instance.
  // This is required because there's no way to get a "loose" component into the view
  // hierarchy without it being part of an element's ContentView or part of an IVisual.
  // ContentViews are appended by the custom element's attach process. IVisuals can only
  // be added via a RenderSlot. So, this form of view effectively enables a single
  // component to be added into a RenderSlot.
  // It's likely that after the RenderLocation abstraction is added and RenderSlot is removed
  // that most of this functionality will go away. The rendering engine will still need the ability
  // to create a dynamic component, but the compose element won't need a RenderSlot and an IView in
  // order to add that dynamic component to the DOM. Instead, it should be able to take the single
  // node and use the RenderLocation to add that node to the DOM.
