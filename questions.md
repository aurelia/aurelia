1. For interpolated attribute value like this `<span id="i18n-simple-2" t="${obj.key}"></span>` `Error: Code 101: Unconsumed token.` is thrown. At present I have `TranslationBindingCommand#bindingType = BindingType.BindCommand`, if I change that to `bindingType = BindingType.BindCommand | BindingType.Interpolation`, the other use cases such as `t="simple.text"`, or `t.bind="obj.key"` does not work, as it seems that interpolation has higher priority. It would be nice when the interpolation expression can be fed to the binding, where a simple `evaluate` will produce the interpolated value.
2. The initialization of `I18nService` is async and a task is used to queue the initialization from ctor. The binding uses the service to resolve the translations. Though the process works now without explicitly waiting for the task, the task should ideally be awaited by the consumer. Is there any way that can be done from the binding.
